Framework

# AppKit

Construct and manage a graphical, event-driven user interface for your macOS app.

## Overview

AppKit contains the objects you need to build the user interface for a macOS app. In addition to drawing windows, buttons, panels, and text fields, it handles all the event management and interaction between your app, people, and macOS.

Aside from drawing and managing interactions, AppKit handles printing, animating, as well as creating documents with large amounts of data efficiently. The framework also contains built-in support for localization and accessibility to ensure that your app reaches as many people as possible.

AppKit also works with SwiftUI, so you can implement parts of your AppKit app in SwiftUI or mix interface elements between the two frameworks. For example, you can place AppKit views and view controllers inside SwiftUI views, and vice versa.

Collection

- Views and Controls

API Collection

# Views and Controls

Present your content onscreen and handle user input and events.

## Overview

Views and controls are the building blocks of your app’s user interface.

Views can host other views. Embedding one view inside another creates a containment relationship between the host view (known as the _superview_) and the embedded view (known as the _subview_). View hierarchies make it easier to manage views.

You can also use views to do any of the following:

- Respond to touches and other events (either directly or in coordination with gesture recognizers).

- Draw custom content using Core Graphics.

- Respond to focus changes.

- Animate the size, position, and appearance attributes of the view using Core Animation.

Favor AppKit views and controls whenever possible. These components adapt automatically to system changes, and many support appearance customizations to support the look and feel you want in your app. When AppKit doesn’t provide the exact view or control you need, you can create a custom view.

`NSView` is the root class for all views and defines their common behavior. `NSControl` defines additional behaviors that are specific to buttons, switches, and other views designed for user interactions.

For additional information about how to use views and controls, see Human Interface Guidelines.

## Topics

# View Layout

Position and size views using a stack view or Auto Layout constraints.

## Overview

When you design your app’s interface, you position views and other interface elements in your app’s windows and size them appropriately. However, the size and position of those views may need to change at runtime for a few reasons:

- The user resizes the window containing your views.

- The user’s language choice requires size changes for labels and text-based views.

`NSStackView` objects adjust the position of their contained views automatically when interface dimensions change. Alternatively, Auto Layout constraints let you specify the rules that determine the precise size and position of the views in your interface

# Supporting Continuity Camera in Your Mac App

Incorporate scanned documents and pictures from a user’s iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch into your Mac app using Continuity Camera.

## Overview

With Continuity Camera in macOS 10.14 and later, and iOS 12 and later, you can use your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to scan documents or take a picture of something nearby and then access those documents or pictures instantly from your app.

If your app works with images, this feature can be a convenient way to get images into the app. For example, a text-editing app can use this feature to easily incorporate images into a document. It can also be a handy way to bring images into a social media app.

Apps using `NSTextView` get Continuity Camera support automatically. When the user Control-clicks in an app’s text view, a Continuity Camera menu item appears. The user can then capture a photo or scan a document on their iPhone or iPad, and it automatically appears in the text view. The image is then accessible as an attachment in the `NSTextView` text storage object.

If you’re not using `NSTextView`, you need to add support to your macOS interface to enable Continuity Camera, and to merge photos taken from the user’s iOS device.

### Enable Support in Your Responder Objects

You must tell AppKit that your app can take advantage of any image data originating from Continuity Camera. You do this in responder objects, such as a view controller.

When the Continuity Camera menu item appears, AppKit calls the `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method of your responder objects in the current responder chain to find an object that can handle image data from Continuity Camera. Override this method to let AppKit know that your responder object supports image data that Continuity Camera generates. When the user captures a photo or scans a document using Continuity Camera, AppKit places the image data on the pasteboard and calls the designated responder object to handle the data.

Your responder’s `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` implementation must verify that it can receive pasteboard image data of the specified type, then return the object to receive the image data when AppKit places it on the pasteboard. Your `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method can designate the same receiver object to handle the image data.

Here’s an example implementation:

if let pasteboardType = returnType,
// The service is image-related.
NSImage.imageTypes.contains(pasteboardType.rawValue) {
return self // This object can receive image data.
} else {
// Let objects in the responder chain handle the message.
return super.validRequestor(forSendType: sendType, returnType: returnType)
}
}

Note that your `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method can return a different object to receive the image data. For example, implement the `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method in your view controller and perform the checks, but return a view object to incorporate the data. You can also return a parent or managing object instead. For example, the following code implements `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` in a window controller, but returns the active view controller to target the pasted image:

if let pasteboardType = returnType,
// The service is image-related.
NSImage.imageTypes.contains(pasteboardType.rawValue) {
// Specify the active view controller to receive the image data.
return self.contentViewController
} else {
// Let objects in the responder chain handle the message.
return super.validRequestor(forSendType: sendType, returnType: returnType)
}
}

After you implement `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` and specify an object to receive the image data, AppKit enables the Continuity Camera menu item for the designated menus in your app, including contextual menus associated with your view.

### Add a Continuity Camera Menu Item

The user initiates Continuity Camera by using a menu item in one of your app’s menu bar menus or contextual menus. You can add a Continuity Camera menu item to any of your app’s menu bar menus, or have AppKit automatically add a Continuity Camera menu item to one of your app’s contextual menus. A good place to include a Continuity Camera menu item is in menus that contain options for performing editing-related activities, such as the File and Insert menus.

To add a Continuity Camera menu item to one of your app’s menu bar menus, locate the storyboard file where your menu bar is defined, and follow these steps in Interface Builder:

1. Add an item to your app’s menu.

2. Set the name of the item, such as “Take Picture.” AppKit provides the name later.

3. In the Identity inspector, set the Identifier property of the menu item to `NSMenuItemImportFromDeviceIdentifier` (defined in `NSMenuItem.h`).

Here’s how it looks:

If your app doesn’t use a storyboard, you can programmatically add the menu item by following these steps:

1. Get the app’s main menu bar.

2. Get the desired menu item for the insertion from the menu bar.

3. Get the submenu for the menu item.

4. Create the Camera menu item and specify the name, such as “Take Picture.”

5. Set the Identifier property for the Camera menu item to `NSMenuItem.importFromDeviceIdentifier`.

6. Add the Camera menu item to the submenu.

A good place to do this is in your app delegate’s `applicationWillFinishLaunching(_:)` method as the following example shows:

func applicationWillFinishLaunching(_ aNotification: Notification) {
let mainMenu = NSApplication.shared.mainMenu
// Get the File menu item.
guard let fileMenu = mainMenu?.item(at: 1) else { return }
// Get the File menu item submenu.
guard let subMenu = fileMenu.submenu else { return }
// Create the Camera menu item.
let cameraMenuItem =
NSMenuItem(title: "Take Picture", action: nil, keyEquivalent: "")
// Specify the Continuity Camera menu item identifier.
cameraMenuItem.identifier = NSMenuItem.importFromDeviceIdentifier
// Add the Camera menu item to the File menu.
subMenu.addItem(cameraMenuItem)
}

You don’t add a Continuity Camera menu item directly to your app’s contextual menus. Instead, you enable the appropriate support in your app’s responder objects as the previous section describes, and AppKit adds the menu item for you.

For example, the following code demonstrates how to display a contextual menu in response to a mouse-down event, and have AppKit insert the menu item. This code overrides the `mouseDown(with:)` method and creates a menu. It then invokes the `NSMenu` class method `popUpContextMenu(_:with:for:)`, passing the event object related to the mouse-down event and the view that owns the contextual menu. AppKit automatically inserts the Continuity Camera menu item in the contextual menu for you.

override func mouseDown(with event: NSEvent) {
let theMenu = NSMenu(title: "Contextual Menu")
/*
Display a contextual menu over the view for the mouse-down event.
AppKit automatically inserts the Continuity Camera menu item.
*/
NSMenu.popUpContextMenu(theMenu, with: event, for: self.view)
}

When the user selects the Continuity Camera menu item, the system automatically launches the Continuity Camera interface on the user’s device. After the user captures an image, AppKit places that image on the app’s pasteboard.

### Incorporate the Image Data from the Pasteboard

You need to incorporate the captured images into your app after AppKit places them on the pasteboard. AppKit then calls the active responder object’s `readSelection(from:)` method to read the image data. The `readSelection(from:)` method supports Continuity Camera image data and other types of data in your app. Use that method to determine whether the image is in a format your app supports, and incorporate that image data into your app.

Here’s an example implementation of the `readSelection(from:)` method:

// Verify that the pasteboard contains image data.
guard pasteboard.canReadItem(withDataConformingToTypes: NSImage.imageTypes) else {
return false
}
// Load the image.
guard let image = NSImage(pasteboard: pasteboard) else {
return false
}
// Incorporate the image into the app.
self.myImageView.image = image
// This method has successfully read the pasteboard data.
return true
}

# Mouse, Keyboard, and Trackpad

Handle events related to mouse, keyboard, and trackpad input.

## Overview

The `NSResponder` class defines the responder chain, an ordered list of objects that respond to user events. When the user clicks the mouse button, taps on the trackpad, or presses a key, an event is generated and passed up the responder chain in search of an object that can respond to it. Any object that handles events must inherit from the `NSResponder` class. The core AppKit classes, `NSApplication`, `NSWindow`, and `NSView`, inherit from `NSResponder`.

An `NSApplication` object maintains a list of `NSWindow` objects—one for each window belonging to the app—and each `NSWindow` object maintains a hierarchy of `NSView` objects. This view hierarchy is used for both drawing the user interface and for handling events.

An `NSWindow` object handles window-level events and distributes other events to its views. An `NSWindow` object also has a delegate allowing you to customize its behavior.

# Accessibility for AppKit

Make your AppKit apps accessible to everyone who uses macOS.

## Overview

Making your app accessible means making it usable by everyone. By designing your app with accessibility in mind, you make it possible for everyone to enjoy your app. For more information, see Accessibility.

AppKit controls and views come with built-in accessibility, providing an accessible user experience by default. Typically, you don’t need to do extra work to enable the standard accessibility features.

In some cases, you might want to modify the default values to better represent your app, to provide additional context, or to modify the user’s flow through the app. AppKit makes these customizations straightforward, involving a few lines of code or Interface Builder adjustments as you define your user interface. For more information about customizing accessibility for AppKit elements, see `NSAccessibilityProtocol`.

If your app contains custom user interface elements that subclass `NSView`, enhance the accessibility of those elements using the role-based protocols in Custom Controls. If your app contains custom user interface elements that don’t inherit from `NSView` or one of the other AppKit classes with built-in accessibility, make those elements accessible by subclassing `NSAccessibilityElement`.

If you build your app with SwiftUI, see Accessibility modifiers.

## Overview

In most cases, you can lay out your app’s text using the `NSTextField` or `NSTextView` classes (or their subclasses). Use the `NSTextField` class to add either a label or a simple text input. Use the `NSTextView` class to provide more comprehensive layout and editing features for larger bodies of text.

For example, `NSTextView` supports rich text, attachments (graphics, file, and other), input management and key binding, and marked text attributes. `NSTextView` works with the font panel and menu, rulers and paragraph styles, the Services facility (for example, the spell-checking service), and the pasteboard.

`NSTextView` also allows customizing through delegation and notifications—you rarely need to subclass `NSTextView`. You rarely create instances of `NSTextView` programmatically either, because objects on Interface Builder’s palettes, such as `NSTextField`, `NSForm`, and `NSScrollView`, already contain `NSTextView` objects.

For even more powerful and more creative text manipulation (such as displaying text in a circle) see TextKit.

### Spell-checking

The `NSSpellServer` class lets you define a spell-checking service and provide it as a service to other apps. To connect your app to a spell-checking service, use the `NSSpellChecker` class. The `NSIgnoreMisspelledWords` and `NSChangeSpelling` protocols support the spell-checking mechanism.

# TextKit

Manage text storage and perform custom layout of text-based content in your app’s views.

## Overview

TextKit provides several classes to control the layout of text, such as `NSTextContentStorage`, `NSTextLayoutManager`, and `NSTextContainer`.

Additionally, TextKit uses `NSAttributedString` objects extensively. The `NSTextStorage` class is a subclass of `NSMutableAttributedString`, and many of the TextKit classes, for example, the classes listed in `Formatted content`, focus on creating complex `NSAttributedString` instances. Use these classes to specify your text’s format.

Most of the time, you can use TextKit to fine tune the formatting and layout of a `NSTextView` by modifying various properties of your view’s layout manager, text container, or text storage objects in your app. If you need more control, you can also use TextKit to build your text controls.

## Topics

Class

# NSAppearance

An object that manages standard appearance attributes for UI elements in an app.

class NSAppearance

## Mentioned in

Choosing a Specific Appearance for Your macOS App

## Overview

An `NSAppearance` object manages how AppKit renders your app’s UI elements. Specifically, appearance objects determine which colors and images AppKit uses when drawing windows, views, and controls. Although you can use an appearance object to determine how to draw custom views and controls, a better approach is to choose colors and images that adapt automatically to the current appearance. For example, define a color asset whose actual color value changes for light and dark appearances. You can assign specific appearances to your views in Interface Builder.

The user chooses the default appearance for the system, but you can override that appearance for all or part of your app. Apps inherit the default system appearance, windows inherit their app’s appearance, and views inherit the appearance of their nearest ancestor (either a superview or window). To force a window or view to adopt an appearance, assign a specific appearance object to its `appearance` property.

When AppKit draws a control, it automatically sets the current appearance on the current thread to the control’s appearance. The current appearance influences the drawing path and return values you get when you access system fonts and colors. The current appearance also affects the appearance of text and images, such as the text and template images in a toolbar.

## Topics

### Creating an Appearance

`init?(named: NSAppearance.Name)`

Creates an appearance object based on the name of one of the standard system appearances.

`init?(appearanceNamed: NSAppearance.Name, bundle: Bundle?)`

Creates an appearance object from the named appearance file located in the specified bundle.

`init?(coder: NSCoder)`

### Getting the Appearance Name

`var name: NSAppearance.Name`

The name of the appearance.

`struct Name`

### Determining the Most Appropriate Appearance

Returns the appearance name that most closely matches the current appearance object.

### Getting and Setting the Current Appearance

The appearance that the system uses for color and asset resolution, and that’s active for drawing, usually from locking focus on a view.

Sets the appearance to be the active drawing appearance and perform the specified block.

`class var current: NSAppearance!`

Returns the appearance object that’s active on the current thread.

Deprecated

### Managing Vibrancy

`var allowsVibrancy: Bool`

Specifies whether the current appearance allows vibrancy.

## Mentioned in

Passing control from one app to another with cooperative activation

Choosing a Specific Appearance for Your macOS App

## Overview

Every app uses a single instance of `NSApplication` to control the main event loop, keep track of the app’s windows and menus, distribute events to the appropriate objects (that’s, itself or one of its windows), set up autorelease pools, and receive notification of app-level events. An `NSApplication` object has a delegate (an object that you assign) that’s notified when the app starts or terminates, is hidden or activated, should open a file selected by the user, and so forth. By setting the delegate and implementing the delegate methods, you customize the behavior of your app without having to subclass `NSApplication`. In your app’s `main()` function, create the `NSApplication` instance by calling the `shared` class method. After creating the application object, the `main()` function should load your app’s main nib file and then start the event loop by sending the application object a `run()` message. If you create an Application project in Xcode, this `main()` function is created for you. The `main()` function Xcode creates begins by calling a function named `NSApplicationMain()`, which is functionally similar to the following:

void NSApplicationMain(int argc, char *argv[]) {
[NSApplication sharedApplication];
[NSBundle loadNibNamed:@"myMain" owner:NSApp];
[NSApp run];
}

The `shared` class method initializes the display environment and connects your program to the window server and the display server. The `NSApplication` object maintains a list of all the `NSWindow` objects the app uses, so it can retrieve any of the app’s `NSView` objects. The `shared` method also initializes the global variable `NSApp`, which you use to retrieve the `NSApplication` instance. `shared` only performs the initialization once. If you invoke it more than once, it returns the application object it created previously.

The shared `NSApplication` object performs the important task of receiving events from the window server and distributing them to the proper `NSResponder` objects. `NSApp` translates an event into an `NSEvent` object, then forwards the event object to the affected `NSWindow` object. All keyboard and mouse events go directly to the `NSWindow` object associated with the event. The only exception to this rule is if the Command key is pressed when a key-down event occurs; in this case, every `NSWindow` object has an opportunity to respond to the event. When a window object receives an `NSEvent` object from `NSApp`, it distributes it to the objects in its view hierarchy.

`NSApplication` is also responsible for dispatching certain Apple events received by the app. For example, macOS sends Apple events to your app at various times, such as when the app is launched or reopened. `NSApplication` installs Apple event handlers to handle these events by sending a message to the appropriate object. You can also use the `NSAppleEventManager` class to register your own Apple event handlers. The `applicationWillFinishLaunching(_:)` method is generally the best place to do so. For more information on how events are handled and how you can modify the default behavior, including information on working with Apple events in scriptable apps, see How Cocoa Applications Handle Apple Events in Cocoa Scripting Guide.

The `NSApplication` class sets up `@autorelease` block during initialization and inside the event loop—specifically, within its initialization (or `shared`) and `run()` methods. Similarly, the methods AppKit adds to `Bundle` employ `@autorelease` blocks during the loading of nib files. These `@autorelease` blocks aren’t accessible outside the scope of the respective `NSApplication` and `Bundle` methods. Typically, an app creates objects either while the event loop is running or by loading objects from nib files, so this lack of access usually isn’t a problem. However, if you do need to use Cocoa classes within the `main()` function itself (other than to load nib files or to instantiate `NSApplication`), you should create an `@autorelease` block to contain the code using the classes.

### The delegate and notifications

You can assign a delegate to your `NSApplication` object. The delegate responds to certain messages on behalf of the object. Some of these messages, such as `application(_:openFile:)`, ask the delegate to perform an action. Another message, `applicationShouldTerminate(_:)`, lets the delegate determine whether the app should be allowed to quit. The `NSApplication` class sends these messages directly to its delegate.

`NSApplication` also posts notifications to the app’s default notification center. Any object may register to receive one or more of the notifications posted by `NSApplication` by sending the message `addObserver(_:selector:name:object:)` to the default notification center (an instance of the `NSNotificationCenter` class). The delegate of `NSApplication` is automatically registered to receive these notifications if it implements certain delegate methods. For example, `NSApplication` posts notifications when it’s about to be done launching the app and when it’s done launching the app ( `willFinishLaunchingNotification` and `didFinishLaunchingNotification`). The delegate has an opportunity to respond to these notifications by implementing the methods `applicationWillFinishLaunching(_:)` and `applicationDidFinishLaunching(_:)`. If the delegate wants to be informed of both events, it implements both methods. If it needs to know only when the app is finished launching, it implements only `applicationDidFinishLaunching(_:)`.

### System services

`NSApplication` interacts with the system services architecture to provide services to your app through the Services menu.

### Subclassing notes

You rarely should find a real need to create a custom `NSApplication` subclass. Unlike some object-oriented libraries, Cocoa doesn’t require you to subclass `NSApplication` to customize app behavior. Instead it gives you many other ways to customize an app. This section discusses both some of the possible reasons to subclass `NSApplication` and some of the reasons _not_ to subclass `NSApplication`.

To use a custom subclass of `NSApplication`, send `shared` to your subclass rather than directly to `NSApplication`. If you create your app in Xcode, you can accomplish this by setting your custom app class to be the principal class. In Xcode, double-click the app target in the Groups and Files list to open the Info window for the target. Then display the Properties pane of the window and replace “NSApplication” in the Principal Class field with the name of your custom class. The `NSApplicationMain` function sends `shared` to the principal class to obtain the global app instance ( `NSApp`)—which in this case will be an instance of your custom subclass of `NSApplication`.

#### Methods to override

Generally, you subclass `NSApplication` to provide your own special responses to messages that are routinely sent to the global app object ( `NSApp`). `NSApplication` doesn’t have primitive methods in the sense of methods that you must override in your subclass. Here are four methods that are possible candidates for overriding:

- Override `run()` if you want the app to manage the main event loop differently than it does by default. (This a critical and complex task, however, that you should only attempt with good reason).

- Override `sendEvent(_:)` if you want to change how events are dispatched or perform some special event processing.

- Override `requestUserAttention(_:)` if you want to modify how your app attracts the attention of the user (for example, offering an alternative to the bouncing app icon in the Dock).

- Override `target(forAction:)` to substitute another object for the target of an action message.

#### Special considerations

The global app object uses `@autorelease` blocks in its `run()` method; if you override this method, you’ll need to create your own `@autorelease` blocks.

Do not override `shared`. The default implementation, which is essential to app behavior, is too complex to duplicate on your own.

#### Alternatives to subclassing

`NSApplication` defines numerous Delegation methods that offer opportunities for modifying specific aspects of app behavior. Instead of making a custom subclass of `NSApplication`, your app delegate may be able to implement one or more of these methods to accomplish your design goals. In general, a better design than subclassing `NSApplication` is to put the code that expresses your app’s special behavior into one or more custom objects called controllers. Methods defined in your controllers can be invoked from a small dispatcher object without being closely tied to the global app object.

Class

# NSRunningApplication

An object that can manipulate and provide information for a single instance of an app.

class NSRunningApplication

## Mentioned in

Passing control from one app to another with cooperative activation

## Overview

Some properties of an app are fixed, such as the bundle identifier. Other properties may vary over time, such as whether the app is hidden. Properties that vary can be observed with key-value observing, in which case the description comment for the method notes this capability.

Properties that vary over time are inherently race-prone. For example, a hidden app may unhide itself at any time. To ameliorate this, properties persist until the next turn of the main run loop in a common mode. For example, if you repeatedly poll an unhidden app for its hidden property without allowing the run loop to run, it will continue to return `false`, even if the app hides, until the next turn of the run loop.

`NSRunningApplication` is thread safe, in that its properties are returned atomically. However, it is still subject to the main run loop policy described above. If you access an instance of `NSRunningApplication` from a background thread, be aware that its time-varying properties may change from under you as the main run loop runs (or not).

An `NSRunningApplication` instance remains valid after the app exits. However, most properties lose their significance, and some properties may not be available on a terminated application.

To access the list of all running apps, use the `runningApplications` method in `NSWorkspace`.

Class

# NSSharingService

An object that facilitates the sharing of content with social media services, or with apps like Mail or Safari.

class NSSharingService

## Overview

An `NSSharingService` object provides a consistent user experience for sharing items— `NSURL` objects, `NSString` objects, `NSImage` objects, video (through file URLs), of any object that implements the `NSPasteboardWriting` protocol—in macOS.

For any item or group of items, the `NSSharingService` displays a sheet with the content to share. A sharing service can create a post on a social network like Twitter or Facebook, send a message by email or iMessage, upload videos to viewing services, or send a file using AirDrop.

You can use `NSSharingService` objects directly in your app. The following example shows how to create a button that shares content directly to a social media service.

- (void)awakeFromNib
{
NSSharingService * service = [NSSharingService sharingServiceNamed:NSSharingServiceNamePostOnTwitter];
[myShareOnTwitterButton setTitle:service.title];
[myShareOnTwitterButton setEnabled:[service canPerformWithItems:nil]];
}

- (IBAction)shareOnTwitter:(id)sender
{
// Items to share
NSAttributedString *text = [self.textView attributedString];
NSImage *image = [self.imageView image];
NSArray * shareItems = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:text, image, nil];

NSSharingService *service = [NSSharingService sharingServiceNamed:NSSharingServiceNamePostOnTwitter];
service.delegate = self;
[service performWithItems:shareItems];
}

# NSSharingServicePicker

A list of sharing services that the user can choose from.

class NSSharingServicePicker

## Overview

An `NSSharingServicePicker` object presents an interface for sharing one or more items using a specific service. In macOS 12 and earlier, this picker displays a menu with a list of services that someone can use to share the item. In macOS 13 and later, the picker displays a popover with a preview of the item and the list of services. When someone chooses a service, the picker automatically shares the proposed item with that service.

Create a sharing service picker and configure it with a delegate object to monitor interactions. Your delegate must conform to the `NSSharingServicePickerDelegate` protocol. Present the picker from your interface using the `show(relativeTo:of:preferredEdge:)` method.

# NSSharingServicePickerToolbarItem

A toolbar item that displays the macOS share sheet.

@MainActor
class NSSharingServicePickerToolbarItem

## Overview

An `NSSharingServicePickerToolbarItem` object is a standard item you add to your window’s toolbar. When someone clicks it, the item displays the macOS share sheet. Use this item to share the selected or focal content from the current window. For example, you might share the photo someone is viewing, the currently selected text, or the window’s associated document.

Provide the items to share using the associated `delegate` object. For an app built using Mac Catalyst, provide the items from the object in the `activityItemsConfiguration` property.

Protocol

# NSCloudSharingServiceDelegate

A set of methods for responding to the life cycle events of the cloud-sharing service.

macOS

protocol NSCloudSharingServiceDelegate : NSSharingServiceDelegate

## Overview

CloudKit allows a user to share a hierarchy of records with other iCloud users. In macOS, you use `NSItemProvider` and `NSSharingService` to facilitate sharing. Register an instance of `CKShare` with an item provider, and then use a sharing service to present it to the user. You must initialize the service with the `cloudSharing` service name. If the share is new, the user can configure the share and invite other iCloud users to participate. Otherwise, they can use the service to manage the share’s participants and their permissions.

This protocol defines methods that the sharing service calls when it saves changes to a share, or deletes it. The service also asks its delegate to provide the preferred sharing options when creating a new share. Set the service’s `delegate` property to an object that implements this protocol. Use your implementation to provide any appropriate behavior, such as deleting a share you cache locally when the service deletes it from the server.

For more information about CloudKit sharing, see Shared Records.

- AppKit
- NSWindowController

Class

# NSWindowController

A controller that manages a window, usually a window stored in a nib file.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSWindowController

## Overview

Managing a window entails:

- Loading and displaying the window

- Closing the window when appropriate

- Customizing the window’s title

- Storing the window’s frame (size and location) in the defaults database

- Cascading the window in relation to other document windows of the app

A window controller can manage a window by itself or as a role player in AppKit’s document-based architecture, which also includes `NSDocument` and `NSDocumentController` objects. In this architecture, a window controller is created and managed by a “document” (an instance of an `NSDocument` subclass) and, in turn, keeps a reference to the document.

The relationship between a window controller and a nib file is important. Although a window controller can manage a programmatically created window, it usually manages a window in a nib file. The nib file can contain other top-level objects, including other windows, but the window controller’s responsibility is this primary window. The window controller is usually the owner of the nib file, even when it is part of a document-based app. Regardless of who is the file’s owner, the window controller is responsible for freeing all top-level objects in the nib file it loads.

For simple documents—that is, documents with only one nib file containing a window—you need to do little directly with `NSWindowController`; AppKit creates one for you. However, if the default window controller is not sufficient, you can create a custom subclass of `NSWindowController`. For documents with multiple windows or panels, your document must create separate instances of `NSWindowController` (or of custom subclasses of `NSWindowController`), one for each window or panel. An example is a CAD app that has different windows for side, top, and front views of drawn objects. What you do in your `NSDocument` subclass determines whether the default `NSWindowController` or separately created and configured `NSWindowController` objects are used.

### Subclassing NSWindowController

You should create a subclass of `NSWindowController` when you want to augment the default behavior, such as to give the window a custom title or to perform some setup tasks before the window is loaded. In your class’s initialization method, be sure to invoke on `super` either one of the `initWithWindowNibName:...` initializers or the `init(window:)` initializer. The initializer you choose depends on whether the window object originates in a nib file or is programmatically created.

You can also implement an `NSWindowController` subclass to avoid requiring client code to get the corresponding nib’s filename and pass it to `init(windowNibName:)` or `init(windowNibName:owner:)` when instantiating the window controller. The best way to do this is to override `windowNibName` to return the nib’s filename and instantiate the window controller by passing `nil` to `init(window:)`. Using the `init(window:)` designated initializer simplifies compliance with Swift initializer requirements.

Typically, you override one of the methods listed below.

| Method Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `windowWillLoad()` | Override to perform tasks before the window nib file is loaded. |
| `windowDidLoad()` | Override to perform tasks after the window nib file is loaded. |
| `windowTitle(forDocumentDisplayName:)` | Override to customize the window title. |

You can also override `loadWindow()` to get different nib-searching or nib-loading behavior, although there is usually no need to do this.

Class

# NSViewController

A controller that manages a view, typically loaded from a nib file.

@MainActor
class NSViewController

## Overview

View controller management includes:

- Memory management of top-level objects similar to that performed by the `NSWindowController` class, taking the same care to prevent reference cycles when controls are bound to the nib file’s owner.

- Declaring a generic `view` property, to make it easy to establish bindings in the nib to an object that isn’t yet known at nib-loading time or readily available to the code that’s doing the nib loading.

- Implementing the key-value binding NSEditor informal protocol, so that apps using a view controller can easily make bound controls in the views commit or discard changes by the user.

In macOS 10.10 and later, a view controller offers a full set of life cycle methods, allowing you to manage the content of a window in a way that is on a par with iOS view controller management. These methods, presented in order here to reflect a typical cycle, are:

_View life cycle:_

1. `viewDidLoad()`

2. `viewWillAppear()`

3. `viewDidAppear()`

_User interaction cycle:_

1. `updateViewConstraints()`

2. `viewWillLayout()`

3. `viewDidLayout()`

4. `viewWillDisappear()`

5. `viewDidDisappear()`

In addition, in macOS 10.10 and later, a view controller participates in the responder chain. You can implement action methods directly in the view controller. Corresponding actions that originate in the view controller’s view proceed up the responder chain and are handled by those methods.

Prior to OS X v10.10, a typical usage pattern for loading a nib file was to subclass `NSViewController` and override its `loadView()` method to call `[super loadView]`. But in macOS 10.10 and later, the `loadView()` method automatically looks for a nib file with the same name as the view controller. To take advantage of this behavior, name a nib file after its corresponding view controller and pass `nil` to both parameters of the `init(nibName:bundle:)` method.

A view controller employs lazy loading of its view: Immediately after a view controller is loaded into memory, the value of its `isViewLoaded` property is `false`. The value changes to `true` after the `loadView()` method returns and just before the system calls the `viewDidLoad()` method.

A view controller is meant to be highly reusable, such as for dynamically representing various objects. For example, the `addAccessoryController(_:)` methods of the `NSPageLayout` and `NSPrintPanel` classes take an `NSViewController` instance as the argument, and set the `representedObject` property to the `NSPrintInfo` object that is to be shown to the user. This allows a developer to easily create new printing accessory views using bindings and the `NSPrintInfo` class’s key-value coding and key-value observing compliance. When the user dismisses a printing dialog, the `NSPageLayout` and `NSPrintPanel` classes each send NSEditor messages to each accessory view controller to ensure that the user’s changes have been committed or discarded properly. The titles of the accessories are retrieved from the view controllers and shown to the user in menus that the user can choose from.

# NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController

An object that manages a custom view—known as an accessory view—in the title bar–toolbar area of a window.

@MainActor
class NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController

## Overview

Because a title bar accessory view controller is contained in a visual effect view (that is, `NSVisualEffectView`), it automatically handles the blur behind the accessory view and the size and location changes for the content of the view when a window goes in and out of full screen mode. If you’re currently using `NSToolbar` fullscreen accessory APIs, such as `fullScreenAccessoryView`, you should use `NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController` APIs instead.

Typically, you create an `NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController` object, give it your custom view, set the `layoutAttribute` property to ensure that it displays correctly in relation to the title bar, and add the view controller to your window. For more information about `NSWindow` methods you can use to add and remove a title bar accessory view controller, see Managing Title Bars.

Don’t override the `view` property in your `NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController` subclass. Instead, you can override `loadView()`, and set the `view` property in that method.

## Topics

### Configuring a Title Bar Accessory View Controller

`var fullScreenMinHeight: CGFloat`

The visual minimum height of an accessory view that displays below the title bar when the window is in full screen mode.

`var layoutAttribute: NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute`

The location of the accessory view, in relation to the window’s title bar.

### Responding to View Events

Called when the title bar accessory view controller’s view is fully transitioned onto the screen.

`func viewDidDisappear()`

Called after the title bar accessory view controller’s view is removed from the window’s view hierarchy.

`func viewWillAppear()`

Called after the title bar accessory view controller’s view has been loaded into memory is about to be added to the view hierarchy in the window.

# NSSplitViewController

An object that manages an array of adjacent child views, and has a split view object for managing dividers between those views.

@MainActor
class NSSplitViewController

## Overview

A split view controller manages a set of child views that it displays next to each other in a side-by-side or top-to-bottom arrangement.

A split view controller owns an array of split view items ( `NSSplitViewItem`), each of which has a view controller ( `NSViewController`) and corresponding view. The split view controller’s `splitView` object manages those child views and the dividers between them.

By default, a split view arranges its child views vertically from top to bottom. To specify a horizontal (side-by-side) arrangement, implement the `isVertical` property of the `splitView` object to return `true`.

The split view controller serves as the delegate of its `splitView` object. If you override a split view delegate method, your override must call `super`.

To use a split view controller, you must use Auto Layout for the child views and to support animations that collapse and reveal child views. For example, if you design a layout that contains two views, a content area and an optional sidebar, you employ Auto Layout constraints to specify whether the content area shrinks or remains the same size when the sidebar becomes visible.

A split view controller employs lazy loading of its views. For example, adding a collapsed split view item as a new child doesn’t load the associated view until it shows.

# NSStackView

A view that arranges an array of views horizontally or vertically and updates their placement and sizing when the window size changes.

@MainActor
class NSStackView

## Overview

A stack view employs Auto Layout (the system’s constraint-based layout feature) to arrange and align an array of views according to your specification. To use a stack view effectively, you need to understand the basics of Auto Layout constraints as described in Auto Layout Guide.

### Basic Features of Stack Views

A stack view supports vertical and horizontal layouts and interacts dynamically with window resizing and Cocoa animations. You can easily reconfigure the contents of a stack view at runtime. That is, after you create and configure a stack view in Interface Builder, you can add or remove views dynamically without explicitly working with layout constraints. For example, if you configure a stack view with three checkboxes and dynamically add a fourth, the stack view automatically adds constraints as needed, according to the stack view’s configuration. The new checkbox gains dynamic layout configuration from the stack view.

Stack views are nestable: a stack view is a valid element in the `views` array of another stack view.

For more information on `NSStackView`, see Organize Your User Interface with a Stack View.

### Layout Direction and Gravity Areas

A stack view has three so-called _gravity areas_ that each identify a section of the stack view’s layout. A horizontal stack view, which is the default type, has a leading, a center, and a trailing gravity area. The ordering of these areas depends on the value of the stack view’s `userInterfaceLayoutDirection` property (inherited from the `NSView` class). In a left to right language, the leading gravity area in a horizontal stack view is on the left. To enforce a left to right layout independently of language, explicitly set the layout direction by calling the inherited `userInterfaceLayoutDirection` method on your stack view instance.

To specify vertical layout, use the `orientation` property and the `NSUserInterfaceLayoutOrientation.vertical` constant from the `NSUserInterfaceLayoutOrientation` enumeration. In a vertical stack view, the gravity areas always are top, center, and bottom.

### View Detachment and Hiding

A stack view can automatically detach and reattach its views in response to layout changes, such as window resizing performed by the user, or resizing/repositioning of another view in the same view hierarchy. A view in a detached state is not present in the stack view’s view hierarchy, but it still consumes memory. A view that is hidden, but not detached, remains part of the view hierarchy and continues to participate in Auto Layout, but it is not visible and doesn’t receive input events.

To allow views to detach, set the so-called _clipping resistance_ for a stack view to a value lower than its default of `required`. See the `setClippingResistancePriority(_:for:)` method.

You can influence which views detach first (and reattach last). Do this by setting the so-called _visibility priority_ for each view whose detachment order you want to specify. A view with a lower visibility priority detaches before one with a higher priority, and reattaches after it. See the `NSStackView.VisibilityPriority` enumeration and the `setVisibilityPriority(_:for:)` method.

To explicitly detach a view from a stack view, call the `setVisibilityPriority(_:for:)` method with a value of `notVisible`. To explicitly reattach a view to a stack view, call the same method with a value of `mustHold`. If you hide a view that belongs to a stack view (by setting the view’s `isHidden` property to `true`), the view detaches from the stack view by default. Use the `detachesHiddenViews` property to change the default behavior.

The system calls a stack view delegate method when a view is about to be detached and when a view has been reattached, giving you the opportunity to run code at those times. See `NSStackViewDelegate`.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstabviewcontroller

- AppKit
- NSTabViewController

Class

# NSTabViewController

A container view controller that manages a tab view interface, which organizes multiple pages of content but displays only one page at a time.

@MainActor
class NSTabViewController

## Overview

Each page of content is managed by a separate child view controller. Navigation between child view controllers is accomplished with the help of an `NSTabView` object, which the tab view controller manages. When the user selects a new tab, the tab view controller displays the content associated with the associated child view controller, replacing the previous content.

Each tab is represented by an `NSTabViewItem` object, which contains the name of the tab and stores a pointer to the child view controller that manages the tab’s content. Normally, you configure the tab view items at design time using Interface Builder, but you can also add them programmatically using the methods of this class. Always assign a child view controller to new tab view items before adding those items to the tab view interface.

Another way to add tabs programmatically is to add child view controllers directly to the tab view controller. When you call the `addChild(_:)` or `insertChild(_:at:)` method of this class, the tab view controller automatically creates a default `NSTabViewItem` object for the specified view controller. You can fetch the newly created item using the `tabViewItem(for:)` method and configure it. Removing a child view controller with the `removeChild(at:)` method similarly removes the corresponding tab view item.

The tab view controller lazily loads the views associated with each child view controller, creating them only after the corresponding tab is selected. When the tab view controller’s view is first displayed, only the view for the initially selected tab is loaded.

The `tabStyle` property determines the appearance of the tab controls. A tab view controller can display a segmented control or display tabs in the window’s toolbar. You can also provide your own control for displaying tabs. The tab view controller automatically coordinates interactions between designated control and the corresponding `tabView` object.

## Overview

An `NSTabViewItem` is a convenient way for presenting information in multiple pages. A tab view is usually distinguished by a row of tabs that give the visual appearance of folder tabs. When the user clicks a tab, the tab view displays a view page provided by your application. A tab view keeps a zero-based array of tab view items, one for each tab in the view.

Class

# NSPageController

An object that controls swipe navigation and animations between views or view content.

@MainActor
class NSPageController

## Overview

`NSPageController` is useful for user interfaces which control navigating multiple pages as in a book or a web browser history. Page controller inherits from the `NSViewController` class . You must assign the `view` property to a view in your view hierarchy. The `NSPageController` class does not vend a view and does insert itself into the responder chain.

Conceptually, the page controller manages swiping between an array of pages, the `arrangedObjects`. Using the `selectedIndex` property, you can determine how many pages forward or backward the user may navigate.

### Page Controller Modes

There are two modes that an `NSPageController` instance may operate in, history mode and book mode. The main difference between the two modes is that **History mode** expects `pageController.view` to be the content and **Book mode** expects `pageController.view` to be be a container for the content that you will supply by returning `viewControllers` in your delegate methods.

#### History Mode

History mode is designed to be the easiest way to create a history user interface. The page controller will manage the history (the `arrangedObjects` property), snapshots, and user navigation between pages in the history.

As the user navigates to new content, add to the history by calling `navigateForward(to:)`. The page controller will remove any `arrangedObjects` after the `selectedIndex` and then add the object to the end of the `arrangedObjects` array and update the `selectedIndex` property. Just like navigating in a new direction in a web browser, all forward history is lost once the user starts navigating a new path. After returning from `navigateForwardToObject:` you are free to update the contents of `pageController.view`.

##### Delegate Method Invocation During History Mode Swiping

During swiping, the following optional delegate methods are called in the specified order:

The `pageControllerWillStartLiveTransition(_:)` delegate method is invoked when the user starts a swipe action. This is the appropriate point at which to save information that you may need to restore, such as a page’s scrolled location.

Upon returning from the this delegate method, `pageController.view` is hidden. In it’s place the page controller shows a private view hierarchy to animate previously taken snapshots of the page history. This allows the page controller to remain responsive to the user without any required action by your application.Next, if implemented, the `pageController(_:didTransitionTo:)` delegate method is invoked. This delegate method is called after a physically successful swipe, but before the animation has completed. The supplied object is the page the user navigated to – the new `selectedIndex` object in `arrangedObjects`. If background loading tasks need to be initiated this is the appropriate time to do so. However, do not block the main thread or the animation will stutter or pause.

Finally, the pageControllerDidEndLiveTransition: delegate method is invoked after the swipe and swipe animations are complete. You should any position settings or other display specific state stored in the `pageControllerWillStartLiveTransition(_:)` implementation. The `pageController.view` is still hidden at this point and you must call `completeTransition()` on the page controller instance to inform the instance to hide the private transition view and show `pageController.view`. Often you do this immediately, however, if your content is not ready you can call this at a later.

#### Book Mode (View Controller Mode)

Book mode is designed to give you more control over the swiping process and to facilitate more user interface designs than just history, although you can use book mode to create a history user interface.

In this mode, `pageController.view` is a container view and the content views are vended by view controller instances supplied by the delegate object.

To enable book mode, you must implement the following two methods in your delegate: `pageController(_:identifierFor:)` and `pageController(_:viewControllerForIdentifier:)`.

The page controller instance caches the view controllers supplied for each identifier and only asks it’s delegate to create more if one does not already exists in its cache. If you have different type of views you want to swipe in, then supply a different identifier for each type.

When needed, you will be asked to prepare a view controller instance with a page via the optional delegate method `pageController(_:prepare:with:)`. If you do not implement this method, then the `representedObject` of the view controller that would have been passed to this delegate method is set as the object.

The delegate will be asked to prepare a view controller with a `nil` object for each unique identifier it encounters. The NSPageController instance will use this to generate a default snapshot for that identifier.

When using the book mode, if `pageController.view` is layer backed, live layers are used during transition instead of snapshots.

Generally, when using book mode, the set of pages are known and it is your responsibility to set the `arrangedObjects` array property and initially selected page using the `selectedIndex` property.

##### Delegate Method Invocation During Book Mode Swiping

The delegate method `pageControllerWillStartLiveTransition(_:)` is invoked when the user starts a swipe action. As in history mode, this is the appropriate point at which to save information that you may need to restore, such as a page’s scrolled location.

After returning from the `pageControllerWillStartLiveTransition(_:)` delegate method, the page controller takes a snapshot of the `view` in the specified `selectedViewController` and then removes it from `pageController.view`. The page controller replaces it with a private view hierarchy to animate previously taken snapshots. Unlike when building up a history, snapshots may not yet exist for the page being navigated to. In this case, a previously gathered default snapshot is used for that page’s identifier. Regardless, if using a default snapshot or a previously gathered snapshot of actual contents, a view controller is prepared for the page being navigated to, and passed to the delegate. This `viewController.view` is then asked to draw on a background thread while swiping continues. Note that at this point the view does not reside within a window. Once the background threaded drawing completes, the initial snapshot is replaced with the newly generated snapshot.

Next the `pageController(_:didTransitionTo:)` delegate method is invoked after a physically successful swipe, but before the animation has completed. The supplied object is the page the user navigated to - the new object in the `arrangedObjects` array at the `selectedIndex`. Note that the page controller’s `selectedViewController` has not been updated yet. If you need to start some background loading tasks, now is the time to do it. Do not block the main thread or the animation will stutter or pause.

Finally the `pageControllerDidEndLiveTransition(_:)` method is invoked after the swipe and swipe animations are complete. The `selectedViewController.view` is still detached at this point and you must call `completeTransition()` on the page controller to hide the private transition view and update the `selectedViewController`. Often you do this immediately, however, if your content is not ready you can call this at a later.

### Completing the Page Controller Transition

An `NSPageController` instance uses a private view hierarchy during swiping. To create a seamless transition to the new content, it is your responsibility to inform the page controller when you are ready to draw the new content. Ideally, the new content should match the snapshot so the user is none the wiser. You inform the page controller to complete the transition by calling `completeTransition()`. If needed, a view controller is prepared and then the content view is shown (or added) to the view hierarchy and the private transition view is hidden.

During page controller initiated animations, `pageControllerWillStartLiveTransition(_:)` and `pageControllerDidEndLiveTransition(_:)` are invoked on the delegate. Generally during `pageControllerDidEndLiveTransition(_:)` you will call `completeTransition()`. Programatic animations via the animator proxy do not call the delegate methods and you are responsible for calling `completeTransition()` when the animation completes.This is easily done via a completion handler on an `NSAnimationContext` grouping. For example:

//To instantly change the selectedIndex:
pageController.selectedIndex = newIndex;

//To animate a selectedIndex change:
[NSAnimationContext runAnimationGroup:^(NSAnimationContext *context) {\
[[pageController animator] setSelectedIndex:newIndex];\
} completionHandler:^{\
[pageController completeTransition];\
}];

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmedialibrarybrowsercontroller

- NSMediaLibraryBrowserController

Class

# NSMediaLibraryBrowserController

An object that configures and displays a Media Library Browser panel.

class NSMediaLibraryBrowserController

## Overview

From this panel a user can drag media into views in their app. The class provides a standard interface to the MediaLibrary framework content.

For more information see `MLMediaLibrary`, `MLMediaSource`, `MLMediaGroup`, and `MLMediaObject` in Media Library.

### Pasteboard Types

The Media Library Browser defines two pasteboard types for decoding the dragged content and retrieving the media content that is appropriate, one for mediagroup content and one for individual media items

- The `com.apple.MediaLibrary.PboardType.MediaGroupIdentifiersPlist` pasteboard type describes media group content and is published when the user drags items from the upper media-group-organized pane of the Media Library Browser.

- The `com.apple.MediaLibrary.PboardType.MediaObjectIdentifiersPlist` pasteboard type describes individual media items and is published when the user drags media items such as images, movies, or sounds from the media item pane of the Media Library Browser.

There is a third, less specialized, type of media library pasteboard. When the user initiates a drag the pasteboard will contain an array with one more more `NSFilenamesPboardType` pasteboard items, one for each of the files within the group dragged from the media-group-organized pane, and one or more items when a media item or items are dragged from the media item pane.

If you do not need access to the associated Media Library metadata, using the `NSFilenamesPboardType` pasteboard data is the simplest means of retrieving the dragged content, although accessing the media in this manner when your app is sandboxed requires that you use the `NSURL` `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` and `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` methods.

#### The Media Group Pasteboard Type

The `"com.apple.MediaLibrary.PboardType.MediaGroupIdentifiersPlist"` pasteboard type is published when the user drags items from the upper media-group-organized pane of the Media Library Browser.

It consists of an `NSDictionary` plist that contains `keys` with the media source identifiers and corresponding `value` that are arrays of media group identifiers.

To decode the pasteboard data and get `MLMediaGroup` instances, assuming you have an `MLMediaLibrary` instance, use the techniques illustrated in the code listing below.

Listing 1. Retrieving MLMediaGroup instances from the pasteboard

NSDictionary *mediaGroupsDict = [dragPasteboard propertyListForType:@"com.apple.MediaLibrary.PBoardType.MediaGroupIdentifiersPlist"];
if ( mediaGroupsDict )
{
[s appendFormat:@"Media Groups Dictionary: %@\n", mediaGroupsDict];
[s appendString:@"Media Groups:\n"];
for ( NSString *sourceIdentifier in [mediaGroupsDict allKeys] )
{
MLTAppDelegate *appDelegate = (MLTAppDelegate *)[[NSApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
MLMediaLibrary *mediaLibrary = appDelegate.mediaLibrary;
MLMediaSource *mediaSource = [mediaLibrary.mediaSources objectForKey:sourceIdentifier];
if ( mediaSource )
{
NSArray *groupIdentifiers = [mediaGroupsDict objectForKey:sourceIdentifier];
for ( NSString *groupIdentifier in groupIdentifiers )
{
MLMediaGroup *mediaGroup = [mediaSource mediaGroupForIdentifier:groupIdentifier];
[s appendFormat:@"%@\n", mediaGroup];
}
}
}
}

#### The Media Object Pasteboard Type

The `"com.apple.MediaLibrary.PboardType.MediaObjectIdentifiersPlist"` pasteboard type is published when the user drags an item from the media item pane of the Media Library Browser.

It consists of an `NSDictionary` plist that contains `keys` with the media source identifiers and corresponding `value` that are arrays of media object identifiers.

To decode the pasteboard data and get `MLMediaObject` instances, assuming that you have an MLMediaLibrary instance, use the techniques illustrated in the code listing below.

Listing 2. Retrieving MLMediaObject instances from the pasteboard

NSDictionary *mediaObjectsDict = [dragPasteboard propertyListForType:@"com.apple.MediaLibrary.PBoardType.MediaObjectIdentifiersPlist"];
if ( mediaObjectsDict )
{
[s appendFormat:@"Media Objects Dictionary: %@\n", mediaObjectsDict];
[s appendString:@"Media Objects:\n"];
for ( NSString *sourceIdentifier in [mediaObjectsDict allKeys] )
{
MLTAppDelegate *appDelegate = (MLTAppDelegate *)[[NSApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
MLMediaLibrary *mediaLibrary = appDelegate.mediaLibrary;
MLMediaSource *mediaSource = [mediaLibrary.mediaSources objectForKey:sourceIdentifier];
if ( mediaSource )
{
NSArray *objectIdentifiers = [mediaObjectsDict objectForKey:sourceIdentifier];
for ( NSString *objectIdentifier in objectIdentifiers )
{
MLMediaObject *mediaObject = [mediaSource mediaObjectForIdentifier:objectIdentifier];
[s appendFormat:@"%@\n", mediaObject];
}
}
}
}

Class

# NSView

The infrastructure for drawing, printing, and handling events in an app.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSView

## Mentioned in

Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom AppKit view

## Overview

You typically don’t use `NSView` objects directly. Instead, you use objects that descend from `NSView` or you subclass `NSView` yourself and override its methods to implement the behavior you need. An instance of the `NSView` class (or one of its subclasses) is commonly known as a view object, or simply as a view.

Views handle the presentation and interaction with your app’s visible content. You arrange one or more views inside an `NSWindow` object, which acts as a wrapper for your content. A view object defines a rectangular region for drawing and receiving mouse events. Views handle other chores as well, including the dragging of icons and working with the `NSScrollView` class to support efficient scrolling.

AppKit handles most of your app’s `NSView` management. Unless you’re implementing a concrete subclass of `NSView` or working intimately with the content of the view hierarchy at runtime, you don’t need to know much about this class’s interface. For any view, there are many methods that you can use as-is. The following methods are commonly used.

- `frame` returns the location and size of the `NSView` object.

- `bounds` returns the internal origin and size of the `NSView` object.

- `needsDisplay` determines whether the `NSView` object needs to be redrawn.

- `window` returns the `NSWindow` object that contains the `NSView` object.

- `draw(_:)` draws the `NSView` object. (All subclasses must implement this method, but it’s rarely invoked explicitly.) An alternative to drawing is to update the layer directly using the `updateLayer()` method.

For more information on how `NSView` instances handle event and action messages, see Cocoa Event Handling Guide. For more information on displaying tooltips and contextual menus, see Displaying Contextual Menus and Managing Tooltips.

### Subclassing notes

`NSView` is perhaps the most important class in AppKit when it comes to subclassing and inheritance. Most user-interface objects you see in a Cocoa application are objects that inherit from `NSView`. If you want to create an object that draws itself in a special way, or that responds to mouse clicks in a special way, you would create a custom subclass of `NSView` (or of a class that inherits from `NSView`). Subclassing `NSView` is such a common and important procedure that several technical documents describe how to both draw in custom subclasses and respond to events in custom subclasses. See Cocoa Drawing Guide and Cocoa Event Handling Guide (especially “ Handling Mouse Events” and “ Mouse Events”).

#### Handling events in your subclass

If you subclass `NSView` directly and handle specific types of events, don’t call `super` in the implementations of your event-related methods. Views inherit their event-handling capabilities from their `NSResponder` parent class. The default behavior for responders is to pass events up the responder chain, which isn’t the behavior you typically want for a custom view. Therefore, don’t call `super` if your view implements any of the following methods and handles the event:

- `mouseDown(with:)`

- `mouseDragged(with:)`

- `mouseUp(with:)`

- `mouseMoved(with:)`

- `mouseEntered(with:)`

- `mouseExited(with:)`

- `rightMouseDragged(with:)`

- `rightMouseUp(with:)`

- `otherMouseDown(with:)`

- `otherMouseDragged(with:)`

- `otherMouseUp(with:)`

- `scrollWheel(with:)`

- `keyDown(with:)`

- `keyUp(with:)`

- `flagsChanged(with:)`

- `tabletPoint(with:)`

- `tabletProximity(with:)`

If your view descends from a class other than `NSView`, call `super` to let the parent view handle any events that you don’t.

Class

# NSControl

A specialized view, such as a button or text field, that notifies your app of relevant events using the target-action design pattern.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSControl

## Overview

The `NSControl` class is abstract and must be subclassed to be used. Although you can subclass it yourself, more often you use one of the subclasses already defined by AppKit. A control draws content on the screen, automatically handles user interactions with that content, and calls the action method of its target object for any significant user interactions.

### About Delegate Methods

The `NSControl` class provides several delegate methods for its subclasses that allow text editing, such as `NSTextField` and `NSMatrix`. These include: `controlTextDidBeginEditing:`, `controlTextDidChange:`, and `controlTextDidEndEditing:`.

Note that although `NSControl` defines delegate methods, it doesn’t itself have a delegate. Any subclass that uses these methods must have a delegate and the methods to get and set it. In addition, a formal delegate protocol `NSControlTextEditingDelegate` also defines delegate methods used by control delegates.

Class

# NSActionCell

An active area inside a control.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSActionCell

## Overview

An `NSActionCell` does three things: it displays text or an icon; it provides the target object and action method used by its `NSControl` object; and it handles mouse (cursor) tracking by properly highlighting its area and sending action messages to its target based on cursor movement.

The `controlView` of an `NSActionCell` is the view in which the receiver was last drawn.

### Obtaining and Setting Cell Values

The `floatValue`, `intValue`, and `integerValue` methods return the value with their corresponding types after validating any editing of cell content. If the cell is not a text-type cell or the cell value is not scannable to the appropriate type, these return 0.

The `stringValue` method returns the receiver’s value as a string object as converted by the cell’s formatter, if one exists. If no formatter exists and the value is an `NSString`, returns the value as a plain, attributed, or localized formatted string. If the value is not an `NSString` or cannot be converted to one, returns an empty string. The method supplements the `NSCell` implementation by validating and retaining any editing changes being made to cell text.

Calling `setObjectValue:` discards any editing of the receiver’s text and sets its object value to the specified object. After doing so, if the object value is different from what it was before the method was invoked, the method marks the receiver as needing redisplay.

### Configuring an NSActionCell Object

The `NSActionCell` implementation of `setFloatingPointFormat:left:right:` supplements the `NSCell` implementation by marking the receiver as needing redisplay after discarding any editing changes that were being made to cell text.

# Organize Your User Interface with a Stack View

Group individual views in your app’s user interface into a scrollable stack view.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

`NSStackView` simplifies the process of stacking arbitrary views together in one place. You embed a stack view inside an `NSScrollView` object, making the stack’s content scrollable when the user resizes the window. This sample shows how to use `NSStackView` with each individual view either disclosed (expanded) or hidden (collapsed).

The sample’s architecture uses the following protocols:

- `StackItemHeader`. Represents the header’s view and its ability to expand and collapse its corresponding stack item body.

- `StackItemBody`. Represents the stack item’s primary interface.

- `StackItemContainer`. Represents each stack item, combining both the header view and the body view.

- `StackItemHost`. Discloses each stack item container.

The following code shows the `StackItemContainer` class and its associated header and body components:

class StackItemContainer {
// Disclosure state of this container.
var state: NSControl.StateValue

let header: StackItemHeader
let body: StackItemBody

init(header: StackItemHeader, body: StackItemBody) {
self.header = header
self.body = body
self.state = .on
}

This design simplifies adding stack items as view controllers. When you adopt these protocols, all stack items behave the same way and follow the same management rules.

The following illustration shows an example stack view:

### Configure the Sample Code Project

In Xcode, choose your development team on the macOS target’s General tab.

### Configure the System

This sample uses window state restoration so that when the app is relaunched, the user interface returns to the state the user left it in. For state restoration to work, you must deselect the “Close windows when quitting an app” checkbox on the General Pane in System Preferences. To reset state restoration, use Command-Option-Quit when quitting the sample.

### Configure the Stack View

Each stack item’s header and body view controllers are loaded from a storyboard and added to the stack view in the `addViewController()` setup function.

### Restore the User Interface

To restore the stack view’s window on relaunch, use the `NSWindowRestoration` protocol. The disclosure states of all stack view containers are also restored. Each body view controller saves and restores various parts of its user interface.

To restore the states of stack view items, add the `NSRestorableState` to each item’s view controller:

- `FormViewController`. Restores the form field text content.

- `TableViewController`. Restores the table view’s selection.

- `CollectionViewController`. Restores the collection view’s selection.

For `FormViewController`, restoration looks like this:

/// Encode state. Helps save the restorable state of this view controller.
override func encodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder) {

coder.encode(textField.stringValue, forKey: FormViewController.formTextKey)
super.encodeRestorableState(with: coder)
}

/// Decode state. Helps restore any previously stored state.
override func restoreState(with coder: NSCoder) {

super.restoreState(with: coder)
if let restoredText = coder.decodeObject(forKey: FormViewController.formTextKey) as? String {
textField.stringValue = restoredText
}
}

### Choose a Disclosure Appearance

This sample provides two disclosure options:

- A triangle

- A rounded button

The sample project conditionally decides which type of header disclosure control to use by referencing the `DisclosureTriangleAppearance` compilation flag. This flag is predefined in the “Active Compilation Conditions” build settings for passing conditional compilation flags to the Swift compiler. For more about configuring Xcode build settings, see Xcode Help.

If a disclosure appearance is defined, each section in the stack view gets the `NSButton` disclosure style (a triangle). If you prefer the `roundedDisclosure` style (a rounded button with up and down arrows), remove the compilation flag from the Xcode target’s build settings.

Customizing Writing Tools behavior for AppKit views

Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

Adopting the system text cursor in custom text views

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom AppKit view

## Overview

The `NSTextView` class is the front-end class to the AppKit text system. The class draws the text managed by the back-end components and handles user events to select and modify its text, in addition to supporting rich text, attachments, input management, and key binding, and marked text attributes.

`NSTextView` is the principal means to obtain a text object that caters to almost all needs for displaying and managing text at the user interface level. While `NSTextView` is a subclass of the `NSText` class — which declares the most general Cocoa interface to the text system — `NSTextView` adds major features beyond the capabilities of `NSText`. You can also do more powerful and more creative text manipulation (such as displaying text in a circle) using `NSTextStorage`, `NSTextLayoutManager`, `NSTextContainer`, and related classes.

You’re more likely to use the `NSTextView` class than `NSText`. It’s also important to remember that `NSTextView` conforms to a large number of protocols, the methods of which are available to instances of the `NSTextView` class.

`NSTextView` communicates with its delegate through methods declared both by the `NSTextViewDelegate` and by its superclass’s protocol, `NSTextDelegate`. All delegation messages come from the first text view.

In macOS 12 and later, if you explicitly call the `layoutManager` property on a text view or text container, the framework reverts to a compatibility mode that uses `NSLayoutManager`. The text view also switches to this compatibility mode when it encounters text content that’s not yet supported, such as `NSTextTable`.

### About Delegate Methods

The `NSTextView` class communicates with its delegate through methods declared both by the `NSTextViewDelegate` and by its superclass’s protocol, `NSTextDelegate`. All delegation messages come from the first text view.

### Becoming the first responder

When the system invokes `becomeFirstResponder()` on a text view, if the previous first responder was not a text view on the same layout manager as the receiving text view, the receiving text view draws the selection and updates the insertion point if necessary.

To make a text view the first responder, call the containing window’s `makeFirstResponder(_:)` method. Never invoke a text view’s `becomeFirstResponder()` method directly.

### Resigning as first responder

When the system invokes `resignFirstResponder()` on a text view, if the object that will become the new first responder is a text view attached to the same layout manager as the receiver, the receiving text view returns `true` with no further action. Otherwise, it sends a `textShouldEndEditing(_:)` message to its delegate (if any). If the delegate returns `false`, the text view returns `false`. If the delegate returns `true`, the text view hides the selection highlighting and posts an `didEndEditingNotification` to the default notification center and then returns `true`.

In addition to communicating search strings via the find pasteboard, the standard Find panel for `NSTextView` also communicates search option metadata, including case sensitivity and substring matching options. This metadata is stored in a property list as the `findPanelSearchOptions` value on the global find pasteboard. As such, third party applications may store additional keys in this property list to communicate additional metadata as desired to support the various search options common to many third-party applications’ Find panels.

`enum NSFindPanelSubstringMatchType`

The type of substring matching used by the Find panel.

### Notifications

`NSTextView` posts the following notifications as well as those declared by its superclasses, particularly `NSText`. See the Notifications section in the `NSText` class specification for those other notifications.

`class let didChangeSelectionNotification: NSNotification.Name`

Posted when the selected range of characters changes.

`class let willChangeNotifyingTextViewNotification: NSNotification.Name`

Posted when a new text view is established as the text view that sends notifications.

Class

# NSButton

A control that defines an area on the screen that a user clicks to trigger an action.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSButton

## Overview

Buttons are a standard control for initiating actions within your app. You can configure buttons with many different visual styles, but the behavior is the same. When a user clicks it, a button calls the action method of its associated target object. (If you configure a button as continuous, it calls its action method at timed intervals until the user releases the mouse button or the cursor leaves the button boundaries). You use the action method to perform your app-specific tasks.

There are multiple types of buttons, each with a different user interface and behavior. The `NSButtonCell` class defines the button types, and calling the `setButtonType(_:)` method configures them.

If you configure it as an accelerator button (type `NSAcceleratorButton` or `NSMultiLevelAcceleratorButton`), you can set a button to send action messages when changes in pressure occur when the user clicks the button.

Buttons can either have two states (on and off) or three states (on, off, and mixed). You enable a three-state button by calling the `allowsMixedState` method. On and off (also referred to as alternate and normal) states indicate that the user clicked or didn’t click the button. Mixed is typically used for checkboxes or radio buttons, which allow for an additional intermediate state. For example, suppose the state of a checkbox denotes whether a text field contains bold text. If all text in the text field is bold, then the checkbox is on. If none of the text is bold, then the checkbox is off. If some of the text is bold, then the checkbox is mixed.

For most types of buttons, the value of the button matches its state—the value is `1` for on, `0` for off, or `-1` for mixed. For pressure-sensitive buttons, the value of the button indicates pressure level instead.

`NSButton` and `NSMatrix` both provide a control view, which displays an `NSButtonCell` object. However, while a matrix requires you to access the button cell objects directly, most button class methods act as “covers” for identically declared button cell methods. In other words, the implementation of the button method invokes the corresponding button cell method for you, allowing you to be unconcerned with the existence of the button cell. The only button cell methods that don’t have covers relate to the font you use to display the key equivalent and to specific methods for highlighting or showing the state of the button.

Class

# NSColorWell

A control that displays a color value and lets the user change that color value.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSColorWell

## Overview

An `NSColorWell` object lets people select colors from your interface. Incorporate this type of control if your app supports custom color selection. For example, a drawing app might include a color well to let someone choose the color to use when drawing. A color well control displays the currently selected color, and interactions with the color well display interfaces for selecting new colors.

When you create a color well programmatically or in Interface Builder, specify the appearance and interaction style you want. The color well supports color selection using a color picker popover or the system `NSColorPanel` object. When someone selects a new color in one of these interfaces, the color well updates its selected color to match. You can also provide your own color selection process using a custom action and update the color yourself.

## Topics

Class

# NSComboButton

A button with a pull-down menu and a default action.

@MainActor
class NSComboButton

## Overview

An `NSComboButton` object is a button that displays a title string, image, and an optional control for displaying a menu. Use this control in places where you want to offer a button with a default action and one or more alternative actions. Clicking the title or image executes the default action you provide, and clicking the menu control displays a menu for selecting a different action. If you configure the button to hide the menu control, a long-press gesture displays the menu.

After you create a combo button programmatically or in Interface Builder, choose the button `style` you want and add a title or image for your content. A combo button has a default action, which you specify at creation time. You can also change that action later using the inherited `target` and `action` properties. To specify one or more alternative actions, configure a menu with those actions and assign it to the button’s `menu` property.

This control doesn’t use an `NSCell` object for its underlying implementation. It also doesn’t support the addition of a contextual menu.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSPopUpButton

## Overview

An `NSPopUpButton` object uses an `NSPopUpButtonCell` object to implement its user interface.

Note that while a menu is tracking user input, programmatic changes to the menu, such as adding, removing, or changing items on the menu, is not reflected.

## Topics

### Initializing an NSPopUpButton

`init(frame: NSRect, pullsDown: Bool)`

Returns an `NSPopUpButton` object initialized to the specified dimensions.

### Configuring the Cell

`class NSPopUpButtonCell`

The `NSPopUpButtonCell` class defines the visual appearance of pop-up buttons that display pop-up or pull-down menus. Pop-up menus present the user with a set of choices, much the way radio buttons do, but using much less space. Pull-down menus also provide a set of choices but present the information in a slightly different way, usually to provide a set of commands from which the user can choose.

### Setting the type of menu

`var pullsDown: Bool`

A Boolean value indicating whether the button displays a pull-down or pop-up menu.

`var autoenablesItems: Bool`

A Boolean value indicating whether the button enables and disables its items every time a user event occurs.

### Inserting and deleting items

`func addItem(withTitle: String)`

Adds an item with the specified title to the end of the menu.

[`func addItems(withTitles: [String])`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspopupbutton/additems(withtitles:))

Adds multiple items to the end of the menu.

`func insertItem(withTitle: String, at: Int)`

Inserts an item at the specified position in the menu.

`func removeAllItems()`

Removes all items in the receiver’s item menu.

`func removeItem(withTitle: String)`

Removes the item with the specified title from the menu.

`func removeItem(at: Int)`

Removes the item at the specified index.

### Getting the user’s selection

The menu item that was last selected by the user.

`var titleOfSelectedItem: String?`

The title of the item that was last selected by the user.

`var indexOfSelectedItem: Int`

The index of the item that was last selected by the user.

### Setting the current selection

`func select(NSMenuItem?)`

Selects the specified menu item.

`func selectItem(at: Int)`

Selects the item in the menu at the specified index.

Selects the menu item with the specified tag.

`func selectItem(withTitle: String)`

Selects the item with the specified title.

### Getting menu items

`var menu: NSMenu?`

The menu associated with the pop-up button.

`var numberOfItems: Int`

The number of items in the menu.

[`var itemArray: [NSMenuItem]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspopupbutton/itemarray)

The array of menu item objects associated with the button.

Returns the menu item at the specified index.

Returns the title of the item at the specified index.

[`var itemTitles: [String]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspopupbutton/itemtitles)

An array of strings corresponding to the titles of the items in the menu.

Returns the menu item with the specified title.

`var lastItem: NSMenuItem?`

The last item in the menu.

### Getting the indices of menu items

Returns the index of the specified menu item.

Returns the index of the menu item with the specified tag.

Returns the index of the item with the specified title.

Returns the index of the menu item that holds the specified represented object.

Returns the index of the menu item with the specified target and action.

### Setting the cell edge to pop out in restricted situations

`var preferredEdge: NSRectEdge`

The edge of the button on which to display the menu when screen space is constrained.

### Setting the title

`func setTitle(String)`

Sets the string displayed in the receiver when the user isn’t pressing the mouse button.

### Setting the state

`func synchronizeTitleAndSelectedItem()`

Ensures that the item being displayed by the receiver agrees with the selected item.

### Notifications

`class let willPopUpNotification: NSNotification.Name`

Posted when an `NSPopUpButton` object receives a mouse-down event—that is, when the user is about to select an item from the menu.

### Initializers

`convenience init(image: NSImage, pullDownMenu: NSMenu)`

Creates a standard pull-down button with a title, optional image, and menu.

`convenience init(popUpMenu: NSMenu, target: AnyObject?, action: Selector?)`

Creates a standard pop-up button with a menu, target, and action.

`convenience init(title: String, image: NSImage?, pullDownMenu: NSMenu)`

### Instance Properties

`var altersStateOfSelectedItem: Bool`

When the value of this property is `YES`, the selected menu item’s `state` is set to `NSControlStateValueOn`. When the value of this property is `NO`, the menu item’s `state` is not changed. When this property changes, the `state` of the currently selected item is updated appropriately. This property is ignored for pull-down buttons.

`var usesItemFromMenu: Bool`

When `usesItemFromMenu` is `YES`, a pull-down button uses the title of the first menu item and hides the first menu item. A pop-up button uses the title of the currently selected menu. The default value is `YES`.

An interface for configuring a rule-based list of options.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSRuleEditor

## Overview

A rule editor lets the user visually create and configure a list of options that are expressed as a predicate (as described in Predicate Programming Guide). Each row displayed by the rule editor represents a particular path down a tree of choices. The rule editor’s delegate provides the tree of choices to be displayed. The rule editor presents those choices to the user as a row of popup buttons, static text fields, and custom views.

`NSRuleEditor` exposes one binding, `rows`. You can bind `rows` to an ordered collection (such as an instance of `NSMutableArray`). Each object in the collection should have the following properties:

@“rowType”

An integer representing the type of the row ( `NSRuleEditorRowType`).

@“subrows”

An ordered to-many relation (such as an instance of `NSMutableArray`) containing the directly nested subrows for the given row.

@“displayValues”

An ordered to-many relation containing the display values for the row.

@“criteria”

An ordered to-many relation containing the criteria for the row.

@MainActor
class NSPredicateEditor

## Overview

`NSPredicateEditor` provides an `NSPredicate` property— `objectValue` (inherited from `NSControl`)—that you can get and set directly, and that you can bind using Cocoa bindings (you typically configure a predicate editor in Interface Builder). `NSPredicateEditor` depends on another class, `NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate`, that describes the available predicates and how to display them.

Unlike `NSRuleEditor`, `NSPredicateEditor` does not depend on its delegate to populate its rows (and _does not call the populating delegate methods_). Instead, its rows are populated from its `objectValue` property (an instance of `NSPredicate`). `NSPredicateEditor` relies on instances `NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate`, which are responsible for mapping back and forth between the displayed view values and various predicates.

`NSPredicateEditor` exposes one property, `rowTemplates`, which is an array of `NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate` objects.

@MainActor
class NSSegmentedControl

## Overview

The `NSSegmentedControl` class uses an `NSSegmentedCell` class to implement much of the control’s functionality. Most methods in `NSSegmentedControl` are simply cover methods that call the corresponding method in `NSSegmentedCell`. The methods of `NSSegmentedCell` that do not have covers relate to accessing and setting values for tags and tooltips, programatically setting the key segment, and establishing the mode of the control.

The features of a segmented control include the following:

- A segment can have an image, text (label), menu, tooltip, and tag.

- A segmented control can contain images or text, but not both.

- Either the control or individual segments can be enabled or disabled.

- Segmented controls have four tracking modes, described in `NSSegmentedControl.SwitchTracking`. You use these modes with the `trackingMode` property.

- Each segment can be either a fixed width or autosized to fit the contents.

- If a segment has text and is marked as autosizing, then the text may be truncated so that the control completely fits.

- If an image is too large to fit in a segment, it is clipped.

## Topics

### Creating a Segmented Control

Class

# NSSwitch

A control that offers a binary choice.

@MainActor
class NSSwitch

## Overview

The `NSSwitch` class provides a simple interface for displaying and toggling a Boolean state, such as on/off. A switch toggles its `state` and sends its `action` when clicked, activated through the keyboard, or tapped in the Touch Bar. `NSSwitch` also allows dragging between states, and if `isContinuous` is `true`, the switch sends its `action` for each change in position during the drag.

Use a switch to toggle significant preferences, or preferences that provide access to other controls. Avoid creating lists or tables of switches; instead, for general-purpose toggles, use an instance of `NSButton` to display a checkbox.

`NSSwitch` doesn’t use an instance of `NSCell` to provide its functionality. The `cellClass` class property and `cell` instance property both return `nil`, and they ignore attempts to set a non- `nil` value.

## Topics

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmatrix

- AppKit
- NSMatrix

Class

# NSMatrix

A legacy interface for grouping radio buttons or other types of cells together.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSMatrix

## Overview

`NSMatrix` uses flipped coordinates by default. The cells in an `NSMatrix` object are numbered by row and column, each starting with 0; for example, the top left `NSCell` would be at (0, 0), and the `NSCell` that’s second down and third across would be at (1, 2).

The `NSMatrix` class has the notion of a single selected cell, which is the cell that was most recently clicked or that was so designated by a `selectCell(atRow:column:)` or `selectCell(withTag:)` message. The selected cell is the cell chosen for action messages except for `performClick(_:)` ( `NSCell`), which is assigned to the key cell. (The key cell is generally identical to the selected cell, but can be given click focus while leaving the selected cell unchanged.) If the user has selected multiple cells, the selected cell is the one lowest and furthest to the right in the matrix of cells.

## Topics

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsvisualeffectview

- AppKit
- NSVisualEffectView

Class

# NSVisualEffectView

A view that adds translucency and vibrancy effects to the views in your interface.

@MainActor
class NSVisualEffectView

## Overview

Use visual effect views primarily as background views for your app’s content. A visual effect view makes your foreground content more prominent by employing the following effects:

- **Translucency** and the blurring of background content adds depth to your interface.

- **Vibrancy** is a subtle blending of foreground and background colors to increase the contrast and make the foreground content stand out visually.

The material and blending mode you assign determines the exact appearance of the visual effect. Not all materials support transparency, and materials apply vibrancy in different ways. The appearance and behavior of materials can also change based on system settings, so always pick a material based on its intended use. For example, use the `NSVisualEffectView.Material.sidebar` material when your view serves as the background of your window’s sidebar. Don’t select materials based on the apparent colors they impart on your interface.

AppKit creates visual effect views automatically for window titlebars, popovers, and source list table views. You don’t need to add visual effect views to those elements of your interface.

### Choosing a Translucency Effect for Your View

For visual effect views you create yourself, use the `blendingMode` property to specify how and where you want the translucency applied.

- **Behind-window blending** uses the content behind the window as the background for your visual effect view. Behind-window blending makes your entire window stand out above other windows and apps on the desktop. Sheets and popovers use behind-window blending.

- **In-window blending** uses the window’s content as the background for your visual effect view. Typically, you use in-window blending with scrolling content, so that the scrolled content remains partially visible under other parts of your window chrome. Toolbars always use in-window blending.

### Enabling Vibrancy for Foreground Content

The presence of a visual effect view in your view hierarchy does not automatically add vibrancy to your content. For custom views, you must explicitly enable vibrancy by overriding the `allowsVibrancy` property and returning `true`.

It is recommended that you enable vibrancy only in the leaf views of your view hierarchy. Subviews inherit the vibrancy of their parent. Once enabled in a parent view, a subview cannot turn off vibrancy. As a result, enabling vibrancy in a parent view can lead to subviews that look incorrect if they are not designed to take advantage of the vibrancy effect.

Vibrancy works best when your custom views contain grayscale content. Combining a grayscale foreground with a color background works well, because AppKit improves the contrast while only subtly changing the foreground hue. The same isn’t always true when blending two different color values. Dramatically different foreground and background hues can cancel each other out or result in colors that don’t match your original designs.

Instead of defining custom grayscale color assets, consider using the built-in colors `labelColor`, `secondaryLabelColor`, `tertiaryLabelColor`, and `quaternaryLabelColor`. While typically used with text, these colors are applicable with any app content. The built-in colors represent varying levels of contrast for your content, with `labelColor` offering the most contrast, and `quaternaryLabelColor` offering the least contrast.

### Subclassing Notes

If you subclass `NSVisualEffectView`:

- Always call `super` if you override `viewDidMoveToWindow()` or `viewWillMove(toWindow:)`.

- Do not override `draw(_:)` or `updateLayer()`.

Class

# NSBox

A stylized rectangular box with an optional title.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSBox

## Overview

Use box objects to visually group the contents of your window. For example, you might use boxes to group related views. Use an `NSBox` object to configure the appearance of the box.

### Subclassing Notes

An `NSBox` object is a view that draws a line around its rectangular bounds and that displays a title on or near the line (or might display neither line nor title). You can adjust the style of the line (bezel, grooved, or plain) as well as the placement and font of the title. An `NSBox` also has a content view to which other views can be added; it thus offers a way for an application to group related views. You could create a custom subclass of `NSBox` that alters or augments its appearance or that modifies its grouping behavior. For example, you might add color to the lines or background, add a new line style, or have the views in the group automatically snap to an invisible grid when added.

#### Methods to Override

You must override the `draw(_:)` method (inherited from `NSView`) if you want to customize the appearance of your `NSBox` objects. Depending on the visual effect you’re trying to achieve, you may have to invoke `super`‘s implementation first. For example, if you are compositing a small image in a corner of the box, you would invoke the superclass implementation first. If you’re adding a new style of line, you would provide a way to store a request for this line type (such as a boolean instance variable and related accessor methods). Then, in `draw(_:)`, if a request for this line type exists, you would draw the entire view yourself (that is, without calling `super`). Otherwise, you would invoke the superclass implementation.

If you wish to change grouping behavior or other behavioral characteristics of the `NSBox` class, consider overriding `contentView`, `sizeToFit()`, or `addSubview(_:)` (inherited from `NSView`).

#### Special Considerations

If you are drawing the custom `NSBox` entirely by yourself, and you want it to look exactly like the superclass object (except for your changes), it may take some effort and time to get the details right.

# NSValidatedUserInterfaceItem

A protocol that a custom class can adopt to manage the automatic enablement of a UI control.

macOS

protocol NSValidatedUserInterfaceItem

## Overview

The `NSValidatedUserInterfaceItem` protocol works with the `NSUserInterfaceValidations` protocol to enable or disable a control automatically, depending on whether any responder in the responder chain can handle the control’s action method. The `NSMenuItem` and `NSToolbarItem` classes implement this protocol.

By conforming to this protocol, your control can participate in this validation mechanism. To validate a control, the application calls `validateUserInterfaceItem(_:)` for each item in the responder chain, starting with the first responder. If no responder returns `true`, the item is disabled. For example, a menu item that sends the `copy:` action message would disable itself if no responder in the responder chain can be copied.

Class

# NSObjectController

A controller that can manage an object’s properties referenced by key-value paths.

macOS

class NSObjectController

## Overview

`NSObjectController` is a Cocoa bindings–compatible controller class. Properties of the content object of instances of this class can be bound to user interface elements to access and modify their values.

By default, the content of an `NSObjectController` instance is an `NSMutableDictionary` object. This allows a single `NSObjectController` instance to be used to manage many different properties referenced by key-value paths. The default content object class can be changed by calling `objectClass`, which subclasses must override. Your application should use a custom data class that is key-value compliant whenever possible.

### Object Controllers, Entity Mode, and Lazy Fetching

`NSObjectController` and its subclasses, when in entity mode, can now fetch lazily. With lazy fetching enabled using the property `usesLazyFetching`, the controller will try to fetch only a small amount of data from available persistent stores. This can provide a significant improvement in memory use when a large amount of content is stored on disk but just a subset of that data is required in memory.

When set to use lazy fetching, a controller will fetch objects in batches. You can change the default batch size for your application by setting a value for the the user default “ `com.apple.CocoaBindings.LazyFetchBatchSize`”. If you have table views bound to an array controller set to use lazy fetching, the size of the controller’s batch size will grow as the table views’ visible row count grows.

Add, Insert, and Remove operations on controllers that use lazy fetching behave similarly to the same operations on a regular controller. The difference is that it is faster to sort an array controller using lazy fetching if:

- All of the keys in the `sortDescriptors` array are modeled, non transient properties.

- All of the selectors in the `sortDescriptors` array are `compare:` or `caseInsensitiveCompare:`.

- There are no changes in the controller’s managed object context

## Topics

Sample Code

# Navigating Hierarchical Data Using Outline and Split Views

Build a structured user interface that simplifies navigation in your app.

Download

Xcode 13.1+

## Overview

Just as a table view organizes a list of objects linearly, an outline view organizes objects hierarchically. When an app’s user interface becomes more complex, an outline format helps to organize it.

This sample shows how to use `NSOutlineView` to navigate hierarchical data. `NSOutlineView` is a Cocoa view that uses a row-and-column format. Rows expand and collapse to control the amount of information that your app presents. The outline is a hierarchical list of images within container groups. The `DataSource.plist` file predefines the hierarchy.

The outline view uses `NSTableView.SelectionHighlightStyle.sourceList` to:

- Indicate row selection with a light blue highlight.

- Group nodes that look similar to the Finder sidebar.

- Blur background content to add depth to your interface.

It does this by setting the highlight appearance in the storyboard, but you can also configure it in code using `outlineView.selectionHighlightStyle = .sourceList`.

When you use `NSOutlineView` with `NSSplitViewController`, your app presents data in a primary-detail format similar to that of the Xcode Project navigator or the Finder.

### Configure the Split-View Controller

An outline view works well as part of a primary-detail user interface. When the user selects an item from the outline view on the left, the detail view shows the results of the selection. For a primary-detail configuration, use `NSSplitView`, which arranges two or more views in a linear stack running horizontally. The system embeds each view in its own `NSSplitViewItem`. In this sample project, the left split-view item is a view controller called `OutlineViewController`, and the right split-view item is called `DetailViewController`. The `OutlineViewController` class focuses on how to use `NSOutlineView`.

In a primary-detail user interface, the list view on the left must remain the same size when the split view grows or shrinks, while the detail view on the right changes size. To implement this behavior, the app uses the _holding priority_ on the split-view items. The view with the lowest holding priority is the first to increase its width as the split view grows or shrinks. To keep the left split-view item from growing, set its holding priority to `200`, and set the item on the right to `199`.

### Define Hierarchical Content with a Tree Controller

The `NSTreeController` class is the data source for the outline view. It acts as the controller when binding `NSOutlineView` to its hierarchical collection of objects. These objects represent _nodes_, which the `Node` class implements.

A node represents either a container or a document. A container node groups other nodes together. Each container node has its own unique identifier, whereas document nodes have an empty identifier with no children.

This sample uses two kinds of nodes:

- URL-based, representing a container or document on disk.

- Non-URL-based, representing a container or document in memory only.

The sample declares the `Node` class as follows, defining the type, title, identifier, URL, and children nodes:

class Node: NSObject, Codable {
var type: NodeType = .unknown
var title: String = ""
var identifier: String = ""
var url: URL?
@objc dynamic var children = Node
}

The hierarchy consists of nodes that the system reads from the `DataSource.plist` file. Node objects adopt the `Decodable` protocol and the system automatically creates them directly from the property list file.

guard let newPlistURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "DataSource", withExtension: "plist") else {
fatalError("Failed to resolve URL for `DataSource.plist` in bundle.")
}
do {
// Populate the outline view with the .plist file content.
struct OutlineData: Decodable {
let children: [Node]
}
// Decode the top-level children of the outline.
let plistDecoder = PropertyListDecoder()
let data = try Data(contentsOf: newPlistURL)
let decodedData = try plistDecoder.decode(OutlineData.self, from: data)
for node in decodedData.children {
// Recursively add further content from the specified node.
addNode(node)
if node.type == .container {
selectParentFromSelection()
}
}
} catch {
fatalError("Failed to load `DataSource.plist` in bundle.")
}

### Handle Drag and Drop

Users drag and drop nodes from within the outline view to rearrange them, or drag nodes that represent images out to other apps. Users can also drag image files from the Finder, Photos, Mail, or Safari. For more information, see Drag and Drop. This sample shows how to create promise drags by dragging a copy of an image file using `NSFilePromiseProvider`.

### Add a Contextual Menu

The outline view uses contextual menus, or _shortcut menus_, that provide access to frequently used commands. Control-clicking an outline view node opens its contextual menu. The `NSOutlineView` `menu(for:)` function creates these contextual menus. Override this function with the `NSOutlineView` subclass to return a contextual menu. The contextual menu operations are: add, remove, and rename.

### Integrate with the Edit Menu

Use the Edit menu to directly affect the contents of the outline view. This sample adds a Delete menu item for deleting items from the outline view. `OutlineViewController` implements the `IBAction` delete function. The user chooses the menu item or presses the Delete key.

// The user chose the Delete menu item or pressed the Delete key.
@IBAction func delete(_ sender: AnyObject) {
removeItems()
}

Use the `NSUserInterfaceValidations` protocol to enable or disable the Delete menu item according to the selection in the outline view.

if item.action == #selector(delete(_:)) {
return !treeController.selectedObjects.isEmpty
}
return true
}

### Restore the Outline View

This sample saves and restores:

- The disclosure state of each container node.

- The outline view’s selection.

Use the window restoration system’s `encodeRestorableState(with:)` function to save the outline view’s node selection. The next time the app launches, use `restoreState(with:)` to restore that selection.

When the outline view saves the disclosure states, it encodes each container as an archived object by using the `outlineView(_:persistentObjectForItem:)` function.

let node = OutlineViewController.node(from: item!)
return node?.identifier // The outgoing object is the identifier.
}

When the outline view restores the disclosure states, it calls this function for each to translate the archived object to an outline view item.

let node = nodeFromIdentifier(anObject: object) // The incoming object is the identifier.
return node
}

Class

# NSTreeController

A bindings-compatible controller that manages a tree of objects.

macOS

class NSTreeController

## Overview

The `NSTreeController` class provides selection and sort management. Its primary purpose is to act as the controller when binding `NSOutlineView` and `NSBrowser` instances to a hierarchical collection of objects. The root content object of the tree can be a single object, or an array of objects.

An `NSTreeController` object requires that you describe how the tree of objects is traversed by specifying the key-path for child objects specified by `childrenKeyPath`. All child objects for the tree must be key-value coding compliant for the same child key path. If necessary, you should add properties to your model classes that map the child key name to the appropriate class-specific property name.

Child objects can implement a count method (specified to the tree controller using `countKeyPath`) that, if provided, returns the number of child objects available. Your model objects are expected to update the value of the count key path in a key-value observing compliant method. Optionally, you can also provide a leaf key path using `leafKeyPath` that specifies a key in your model object that returns `true` if the object is a leaf node, and `false` if it is not. Changes to the leaf node value of the child object should be made in a key-value observing compliant manner. Providing the leaf node key path can improve performance, because it prevents the `NSTreeController` from having to examine the child object to determine if it is a leaf node.

For more information about using NSTreeController in your app, see Navigating Hierarchical Data Using Outline and Split Views.

- AppKit
- NSDictionaryController

Class

# NSDictionaryController

A bindings-compatible controller that manages the display and editing of a dictionary of key-value pairs.

class NSDictionaryController

## Overview

`NSDictionaryController` transforms the contents of a dictionary into an array of key-value pairs that can be bound to user interface items such as the columns of an `NSTableView`.

The content of an `NSDictionaryController` instance is specified using the inherited method `content` or by binding an `NSDictionary` instance to the `contentDictionary` binding. New key/value pairs inserted into the dictionary are created using the `newObject()` method. The initial key name is set to the string returned by `initialKey` . The initial key name is copied to the newly inserted object, while the object returned by `initialValue` is simply retained. As new items are inserted the controller enumerates the initial key name, resulting in key names such as “key”, “key1”, “key2”, and so on. This behavior can be customized by overriding `newObject()`.

An `NSDictionaryController` instance can be configured to exclude specified keys in a dictionary from being returned by `arrangedObjects` using the `excludedKeys` property. Similarly, you can specify an array of key names that are always included in the arranged objects, even if they are not present in the content dictionary, using the `includedKeys` property.

`NSDictionaryController` supports providing localized key names for the keys in the dictionary, allowing a user-friendly representation of the key name to be displayed. The localized key names are specified by a dictionary (using `localizedKeyDictionary`) or by providing a strings table (using `localizedKeyDictionary`).

The `arrangedObjects` method returns an array of objects that implement the `NSDictionaryControllerKeyValuePair` informal protocol. User interface controls are bound to the arranged objects array using key paths such as: `arrangedObjects.key` (displays the key name), `arrangedObjects.value` (displays the value for the key), or `arrangedObjects.localizedKey` (displays the localized key name). See `NSDictionaryControllerKeyValuePair` for more information.

`NSDictionaryController` overrides `arrangedObjects` to return an array of objects that implement the `NSDictionaryControllerKeyValuePair` informal protocol. See `NSDictionaryControllerKeyValuePair` and Cocoa Bindings Programming Topics for more information.

The constants listed below are used to specify a binding to `bind(_:to:withKeyPath:options:)`, `infoForBinding(_:)`, `unbind(_:)`, and `valueClassForBinding(_:)`. See the Cocoa Bindings Reference for more information.

## Parameters

`object`

Specify the object you want to check. This parameter can be `nil`.

## Return Value

`true` if the object is one of the designated controller markers or `false` if it is not.

## Discussion

This function helps you to create bindings between user interface elements and controller objects. The Application Kit predefines several special marker objects used as values for indicating selection state; currently these are `NSMultipleValuesMarker`, `NSNoSelectionMarker`, and `NSNotApplicableMarker`. These markers are typed as `id` and only exist for the purpose of indicating a state; they are never archived and cannot be used as object values in controls. You use this function to test whether a given object value is a marker, in which case it is not directly assignable to the object that is bound. This check is important, especially since additional markers may be added in the future.

# NSPlaceholders

A set of methods that an object can implement to register default placeholders to be displayed for a binding, when no other placeholder is specified.

## Overview

Individual placeholder values can be specified for each of the marker objects (described in Selection Markers), as well as when the property is `nil`.

Placeholders are used when a property of an instance of the receiving class is accessed through a key value coding compliant method, and returns `nil` or a specialized marker.

## Topics

### Managing default placeholders

`class func setDefaultPlaceholder(_ placeholder: Any?, for marker: Any?, with binding: NSBindingName)`

Sets \`placeholder\` as the default placeholder for the \`binding\`, when a key value coding compliant property of an instance of the receiving class returns the value specified by \`marker\`, and no other placeholder has been specified.

Deprecated

Returns an object that will be used as the placeholder for the \`binding\`, when a key value coding compliant property of an instance of the receiving class returns the value specified by \`marker\`, and no other placeholder has been specified.

### Constants

The following constants are used to describe special cases for a controller’s selection.

Sample Code

# Add Functionality to Finder with Action Extensions

Implement Action Extensions to provide quick access to commonly used features of your app.

Download

Xcode 11.3+

## Overview

Action Extensions can let users access features of your app directly from macOS. For example, if your app contains the functionality to perform image processing, an Action Extension could allow users to process their images directly from Finder. This sample code project creates three Action Extensions, two for processing images and one for processing text. One extension also presents a user interface and all three are available from both the Touch Bar and Finder Preview pane.

The project consists of four targets:

- A macOS app target that has no functionality, but would normally contain your main application.

- `ThumbnailAction`, an Action Extension target that takes images of any type as inputs and outputs thumbnail versions of them. This extension preserves the original input files and creates thumbnails as new files.

- `RemoveOpacityAction`, an Action Extension target that takes PNG images as inputs and replaces them with opaque versions of the same images. During processing, this extension prompts the user for a color to draw as the background behind the transparent image.

- `UppercaseAction`, an Action Extension target that takes text as input and converts it to be uppercase.

The extensions in this sample all accept file data from Finder, process it, and output the data .

### Accept File Data

The system makes Action Extensions available depending on the type of data that the user has selected in Finder. For example, if the user selects a `PNG` file, Action Extensions that support images are shown. Each of the extensions in this sample operate on different kinds of input content:

- `ThumbnailAction` operates on _any_ kind of image.

- `RemoveOpacityAction` operates specifically on PNG images.

- `UppercaseAction` operates on text.

The `NSExtensionActivationRule` key in the `Info.plist` of the associated target determines the conditions under which extensions are available. The value for this key can either be a dictionary, or a string.

`ThumbnailAction` and `UppercaseAction` are both configured with dictionary values. `ThumbnailAction` specifies that it accepts image data with the `NSExtensionActivationSupportsImageWithMaxCount` key and `UppercaseAction` specifies that it accepts text data with the `NSExtensionActivationSupportsText` key.

For more information on valid dictionary keys for `NSExtensionActivationRule`, see the App Extension Keys reference.

`RemoveOpacityAction` uses a `NSPredicate` query as a string value for the `NSExtensionActivationRule`. The query in this sample project filters images to only be valid if they are in PNG format.

SUBQUERY (
extensionItems,
$extensionItem,
SUBQUERY (
$extensionItem.attachments,
$attachment,
ANY $attachment.registeredTypeIdentifiers UTI-CONFORMS-TO "public.png"
).@count == $extensionItem.attachments.@count
).@count == 1

For more information on defining extension activation rules, see the App Extension Programming Guide.

### Process Input Attachments

When a user invokes an Action Extension, the system instantiates the `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` specified in the `Info.plist` and asks it to handle the request through the `NSExtensionRequestHandling` protocol.

The system calls the `beginRequest(with:)` method and passes in an `NSExtensionContext`. To access the input files, use the `attachments` property of the `NSExtensionItem` contained in the `inputItems` array.

Once processing completes, pass output files objects and registering them with `registerFileRepresentation(forTypeIdentifier:fileOptions:visibility:loadHandler:`.

let itemProvider = NSItemProvider()
itemProvider.registerFileRepresentation(
forTypeIdentifier: kUTTypePNG as String, fileOptions: [.openInPlace],
visibility: .all, loadHandler: { completionHandler in
guard let sourceImage = NSImage(contentsOf: sourceUrl) else { return nil }
let thumbnailImage = sourceImage.thumbnailImage
let thumbnailUrl = self.thumbnailUrl(for: sourceUrl)
thumbnailImage.savePNGToDisk(at: thumbnailUrl)
completionHandler(thumbnailUrl, false, nil)
return nil
}
)

To obtain the correct directory path for writing output files, use `url(for:in:appropriateFor:create:)`, passing the `itemReplacementDirectory` constant.

let itemReplacementDirectory = try FileManager.default.url(
for: .itemReplacementDirectory, in: .userDomainMask,
appropriateFor: URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory()), create: true)
let thumbnailFilename = sourceUrl.deletingPathExtension().lastPathComponent + " Thumbnail.png"

Finally, signal that the action is complete by calling `completeRequest(returningItems:completionHandler:)`.

### Process Text Data

The `UppercaseAction` extension accepts any text, either supplied as attachments in the same way as `ThumbnailAction` and `RemoveOpacityAction`, or from other sources such as a standard `NSTextField` control. Check the `attributedContentText` property for input from text fields.

If `attributedContentText` is empty, check for input in the `attachments` property of `NSExtensionItem`.

let outputItem = NSExtensionItem()
outputItem.attributedContentText = NSAttributedString(string: inputContent.string.uppercased())
context.completeRequest(returningItems: [outputItem], completionHandler: nil)

### Present a User Interface

If the action requires user interaction then the extension may present a user interface. Set the `NSExtensionPointIdentifier` key in the `Info.plist` to `com.apple.ui-services` and ensure that the principal class is a subclass of `NSViewController`. If the extension does not require user interaction, specify `com.apple.services` and have the principal class conform to `NSExtensionRequestHandling`.

Extensions that present a user interface show their view controller’s view immediately after the extension calls `beginRequest(with:)` and should input files with the `extensionContext` property of `NSViewController`.

Once the extension’s user interface has completed any required user interaction for the task, process the files in the normal way by calling `completeRequest(returningItems:completionHandler:)`.

To cancel the task, use the `cancelRequest(withError:)`. Pass a `NSUserCancelledError` if the user canceled the task, or an error caused the failure.

let cancelError = NSError(domain: NSCocoaErrorDomain, code: NSUserCancelledError, userInfo: nil)
context.cancelRequest(withError: cancelError)

### Support the Touch Bar and Finder Preview Pane

Users may also access Action Extensions from the Touch Bar and from the Quick Actions menu in Finder’s Preview pane. Set both `NSExtensionServiceAllowsFinderPreviewItem` and `NSExtensionServiceAllowsTouchBarItem` to `YES` in the `Info.plist` to support the Touch Bar and Preview Pane.

Each extension must also have a template icon for use in the Quick Actions menu and the Finder Preview pane. Specify the icon with the `NSExtensionServiceTouchBarIconName` key of the `Info.plist` for each target. For more information, see the Human Interface Guidelines. The color of the Touch Bar button can also be customized using the `NSExtensionServiceTouchBarBezelColorName` key. By default, this is a `TouchBarBezel` color but can be any color in the asset catalog for the target.

For information on how to add Quick Actions to the Touch Bar see the Automator User Guide.

# NSStoryboard

An encapsulation of the design-time view controller and window controller graph represented in an Interface Builder storyboard resource file.

class NSStoryboard

## Overview

You can use storyboard files to define the view and window controllers for all or part of an app’s user interface. Typically, AppKit creates these objects automatically in response to actions defined within a storyboard file itself, such as the clicking of a button or the choosing of a menu item. However, you can use a storyboard object to directly instantiate the initial view controller from a storyboard file or to instantiate other view or window controllers that you want to present programmatically. In the context of a storyboard file, each contained controller is called a _scene_.

A transition from one scene to another in a storyboard is called a _segue_. This same term, and the same Cocoa APIs, express a containment relationship between two scenes. In macOS, containment (rather than transition) is the more common notion for storyboards. For descriptions of the related APIs, refer to `NSStoryboardSegue` and `NSSeguePerforming`.

Class

# NSStoryboardSegue

A transition or containment relationship between two scenes in a storyboard.

class NSStoryboardSegue

## Overview

In this context, a _scene_ is a view controller or a window controller and a _storyboard_ is an instance of the `NSStoryboard` class.

A storyboard segue has a procedural notion of being invoked, known in the API as being _performed_. You can take advantage of hooks into the segue performance process by way of the `NSSeguePerforming` protocol.

You do not create storyboard segue objects directly. Instead, the system creates them as needed as segues are invoked. To run code during initialization and performance of a segue, override the `init(identifier:source:destination:)` and `perform()` methods.

You can initiate a segue programmatically with the `performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)` method of the `NSSeguePerforming` protocol. For example, you might do this to transition from a scene in one storyboard file to a scene in another.

## Topics

### Inspecting a Storyboard Segue

`var sourceController: Any`

Protocol

# NSSeguePerforming

A set of methods that support the mediation of a custom segue.

macOS

protocol NSSeguePerforming : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

When you subclass `NSStoryboardSegue` to express a custom transition or containment relationship between storyboard scenes, you might also want to provide code that prepares the destination/contained view or window controller object. Put this code in an override of the `prepare(for:sender:)` method.

To conditionally disallow the performance of a segue, override the `shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)` method, returning `false`.If you need to programmatically trigger a segue that cannot be expressed in a storyboard file, such as a transition between scenes in different storyboards, use the `performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)` method in this protocol.

## Topics

### Working with Storyboard Segues

`func performSegue(withIdentifier: NSStoryboardSegue.Identifier, sender: Any?)`

Performs the specified segue.

`func prepare(for: NSStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)`

Called when a segue is about to be performed.

Called immediately prior to the performance of a storyboard segue.

Class

# NSDataAsset

An object from a data set type stored in an asset catalog.

class NSDataAsset

## Overview

The object’s content is stored as a set of one or more files with associated device attributes. These sets can also be tagged for use as on-demand resources.

### Initialize data assets

Data assets are initialized from a named data set in an asset catalog. You create data sets during app development. Each data set contains one or more data files. Each file has associated attributes for features of the device, including the minimum amount of memory and the version of Metal. When you initialize the data asset, the system selects the data file that best matches the current device.

For more information on the data set type in an asset catalog, see Data Set Type in Asset Catalog Format Reference. For information on asset catalogs, see Managing assets with asset catalogs.

### Access the data

You access the data file by using the `data` property. Because the property is of type `NSData` it provides methods for accessing the raw data only as bytes and ranges of bytes.

To access structured data, convert the bytes into the appropriate format. The system can convert some data types for you. One example is XML data using the `init(data:)` method of `XMLParser`. Other data types require code for parsing and converting the raw data. You may need to convert larger data files incrementally.

## Topics

### Initializing the data asset

`convenience init?(name: NSDataAsset.Name)`

Initializes and returns an object with a reference to the named data asset in an asset catalog.

`init?(name: NSDataAsset.Name, bundle: Bundle)`

Initializes and returns an object with a reference to the named data asset that’s in an asset catalog in the specified bundle.

### Accessing data

`var data: Data`

The raw data values in the data asset.

### Getting data asset information

`var name: NSDataAsset.Name`

The name of the data set in the asset catalog.

`typealias Name`

The name of a data asset.

`var typeIdentifier: String`

The uniform type identifier for the data asset.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsnib

- AppKit
- NSNib

Class

# NSNib

An object wrapper, or container, for an Interface Builder nib file.

macOS

class NSNib

## Overview

An `NSNib` object keeps the contents of a nib file resident in memory, ready for unarchiving and instantiation. When you create a nib object using the contents of a nib file, the object loads the contents of the referenced nib bundle—the object graph as well as any images and sounds—into memory; but it does not yet unarchive it. To unarchive all of the nib data and thus truly instantiate the nib you must call one of the `instantiate...` methods of `NSNib`.

During the instantiation process, each object in the archive is unarchived and then initialized using the method befitting its type. View classes are initialized using their `init(frame:)` method. Custom objects are initialized using their `init` method. In the case of Cocoa views (and custom views that have options on an associated Interface Builder palette) the initialization process also reads in any values set by the user in Interface Builder.

Once all objects have been instantiated and initialized from the archive, the nib loading code attempts to reestablish the connections between each object’s outlets and the corresponding target objects. If your custom objects have outlets, the `NSNib` object attempts to reestablish any connections you created in Interface Builder. It starts by trying to establish the connections using your object’s own methods first. For each outlet that needs a connection, the `NSNib` object looks for a method of the form `set:` in your object. If that method exists, the nib object calls it, passing the target object as a parameter. If you did not define a setter method with that exact name, the `NSNib` object searches the object for an instance variable (of type `IBOutlet id`) with the corresponding outlet name and tries to set its value directly. If an instance variable with the correct name cannot be found, initialization of that connection does not occur.

After all objects have been initialized and their connections reestablished, each object receives an `awakeFromNib()` message. You can override this method in your custom objects to perform any additional initialization.

### Subclassing Notes

You can subclass `NSNib` if you want to extend or specialize nib-loading behavior. For example, you could create a custom `NSNib` subclass that performs some post-processing on the top-level objects returned from the `instantiateNib...` methods. If you want to modify how nib instantiations are performed, it is recommended that you override the primitive method `instantiate(withOwner:topLevelObjects:)`. Note that the instance variables of `NSNib` are private and thus are not available to subclasses. Any override of `init(nibData:bundle:)` or `init(nibNamed:bundle:)` should first invoke the superclass implementation.

## Topics

### Initializing a Nib

`init?(nibNamed: NSNib.Name, bundle: Bundle?)`

Returns an `NSNib` object initialized to the nib file in the specified bundle.

`init(nibData: Data, bundle: Bundle?)`

Sample Code

# Developing a Document-Based App

Write an app that creates, manages, edits, and saves text documents.

Download

Xcode 11.3+

## Overview

This sample shows how to use the Cocoa document architecture to manage documents. A document is a body of information, such as pages of text, stored in a file locally or in iCloud.

In the Cocoa document architecture, your document is represented by a custom subclass of `NSDocument`. The `NSDocument` class provides most of the behavior for managing your document. In your subclass, you override or fine-tune this behavior by providing custom code for reading and writing document data. A document’s data is called the _data model_. Each `NSDocument` has its own `NSWindowController`, which in turn creates an `NSWindow` object for displaying the document content.

Because a document-based app handles multiple documents that are open at the same time, it uses `NSDocumentController` to manage them. Cocoa provides most of the infrastructure for managing your documents. With file coordination, version management, and conflict resolution among other documents, it provides the easiest path to using iCloud.

### Declare the Document Type

Apps must use Xcode’s Document Types editor to define the types of documents they can open. When Xcode builds your app, it places the document type information in your app’s information property list ( `Info.plist`) file. When users install your app, the system uses that information to determine how to send your app the files to be opened.

Your app declares its document type as a uniform type identifier (UTI), which is a name that identifies a data format. There are two types of UTIs: system UTIs, which are predefined identifiers known to all systems, and user-defined UTIs, which are custom identifiers you can provide for your custom data formats.

The DocumentBasedApp sample has one document type for files containing plain text. Because text is a standard data format, the sample uses the `public.plain-text` system UTI.

The values in the Document Types editor for this sample as follows:

- Name = Plain Text

- Identifier = `public.plain-text`

- Class = `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).Document`

- Role = Editor

- Bundle = Unchecked

`Name` is a human-readable description of the document type, shown in the Finder when users inspect your document type. `Class` is the name of the `NSDocument` subclass that handles this document type. Because this sample edits plain-text documents, its `Role` for this document type is an editor. `Bundle` is turned off because plain-text files aren’t distributed as bundles or packages.

A UTI also specifies which file extension is used by files of this type. The `public.plain-text` UTI specifies extension `.txt`, so the document files that this sample opens or creates have the `.txt` extension at the end of the filename.

### Design the Document Content

This sample app is a text editor, implementing a subclass of `NSDocument` called `Document` with a data model called `Content`.

The `Content` object encapsulates the document’s data into a single package. Putting all of the document’s data into a single `Content` object simplifies data management. For example, it’s easier to add new data elements to the document later.

The `Content` object contains a single attribute called `contentString`, which is made up of a single `String`.

class Content: NSObject {
@objc dynamic var contentString = ""

public init(contentString: String) {
self.contentString = contentString
}

}

Using a centralized `Content` object encapsulates the document’s data model into a single package. If you need to add new data elements to your data model later, you’ll also place them within the `Content` model. The model object is therefore responsible for encoding and decoding its content for reading and writing to disk.

### Design the Document User Interface

This sample follows the Model–View–Controller design pattern by separating its data from the user interface. The _model_ portion is the `Content` object, the _view_ portion is document’s `NSWindow` plus the `NSView` hierarchy it contains, and the _controller_ portion is divided among various controller objects, including your `Document` object. The document’s `NSWindowController` object and the view hierarchy of `NSViewController` objects descend from the window controller’s `contentViewController`.

When you create your `Document` subclass, you determine which window controller the document will use by implementing the `makeWindowControllers()` function. This function also sets a reference to the document object as the `contentViewController`‘s `representedObject`, allowing the user interface elements to bind the document’s data model. Hence the user interface elements get their values through the `representedObject`.

override func makeWindowControllers() {
// Returns the storyboard that contains your document window.
let storyboard = NSStoryboard(name: NSStoryboard.Name("Main"), bundle: nil)
if let windowController =
storyboard.instantiateController(
withIdentifier: NSStoryboard.SceneIdentifier("Document Window Controller")) as? NSWindowController {
addWindowController(windowController)

// Set the view controller's represented object as your document.
if let contentVC = windowController.contentViewController as? ViewController {
contentVC.representedObject = content
contentViewController = contentVC
}
}
}

When you organize the user interface into groups of view controllers called _child view controllers_, `NSViewController` passes down its `representedObject` to all of its children.

override var representedObject: Any? {
didSet {
// Pass down the represented object to all of the child view controllers.
for child in children {
child.representedObject = representedObject
}
}
}

As a result, the `NSTextView` containing the plain text is bound to the document’s data model using Cocoa Bindings to keep the text view’s data in sync with the data model. The `Value` binding of the `NSTextView` is set to the following key path of its view controller:

`representedObject.contentString`

### Read the Document Content

At runtime, the `Document` calls `read(from:ofType:)` function to read in the data of a specified type from a file. This overridden function ignores the `typeName` parameter because this sample handles documents of a single known type.

override func read(from data: Data, ofType typeName: String) throws {
content.read(from: data)
}

### Write the Document Content

At runtime, the `Document` calls `data(ofType:)` function to write the plain text to a file. This overridden function ignores the `typeName` parameter because this sample handles documents of a single known type.

return content.data()!
}

## Overview

A document is an object that can internally represent data displayed in a window and that can read data from and write data to a file or file package. Documents create and manage one or more window controllers and are in turn managed by a document controller. Documents respond to first-responder action messages to save, revert, and print their data.

Conceptually, a document is a container for a body of information identified by a name under which it is stored in a disk file. In this sense, however, the document is not the same as the file but is an object in memory that owns and manages the document data. In the context of AppKit, a document is an instance of a custom `NSDocument` subclass that knows how to represent internally, in one or more formats, persistent data that is displayed in windows.

A document can read that data from a file and write it to a file. It is also the first-responder target for many menu commands related to documents, such as Save, Revert, and Print. A document manages its window’s edited status and is set up to perform undo and redo operations. When a window is closing, the document is asked before the window delegate to approve the closing.

`NSDocument` is one of the triad of AppKit classes that establish an architectural basis for document-based apps (the others being `NSDocumentController` and `NSWindowController`).

For more information about using `NSDocument` in a document-based app, see Developing a Document-Based App.

### Subclassing NSDocument

The `NSDocument` class is designed to be subclassed. That is, the `NSDocument` class is abstract, and your app must create at least one `NSDocument` subclass in order to use the document architecture. To create a useful `NSDocument` subclass, you must override some methods, and you can optionally override others.

The `NSDocument` class itself knows how to handle document data as undifferentiated lumps; although it understands that these lumps are typed, it knows nothing about particular types. In their overrides of the data-based reading and writing methods, subclasses must add the knowledge of particular types and how data of the document’s native type is structured internally. Subclasses are also responsible for the creation of the window controllers that manage document windows and for the implementation of undo and redo. The `NSDocument` class takes care of much of the rest, including generally managing the state of the document.

See Document-Based App Programming Guide for Mac for more information about creating subclasses of `NSDocument`, particularly the list of primitive methods that subclasses must override and those that you can optionally override.

### Document Saving Behavior

The `NSDocument` class implements document saving in a way that preserves, when possible, various attributes of each document, including:

- Creation date

- Permissions/privileges

- Location of the document’s icon in its parent folder’s Icon View Finder window

- Value of the document’s Show Extension setting

Care is also taken to save documents in a way that does not break any user-created aliases that may point to documents. As a result, some methods in any class of `NSDocument` may be invoked with parameters that do not have the same meaning as they did in early releases of macOS. It is important that overrides of `write(to:ofType:)` and `write(to:ofType:for:originalContentsURL:)` make no assumptions about the file paths passed as parameters, including:

- The location to which the file is being written. This location might be a hidden temporary directory.

- The name of the file being written. It is possible that this file has no obvious relation to the document name.

- The relation of any file being passed, including the original file, to the value in `fileURL`.

When updating your app to link against OS X v10.5, keep in mind that it is usually more appropriate to invoke in your app code one of the `NSDocument` `save...` methods than one of the `write...` methods. The `write...` methods are there primarily for you to override. The `saveToURL:ofType:forSaveOperation:error:` method that is meant always to be invoked during document saving, sets the `fileModificationDate` property with the file’s new modification date after it has been written (for `NSDocument.SaveOperationType.saveOperation` and `NSDocument.SaveOperationType.saveAsOperation` only).

Likewise, it’s usually more appropriate to invoke in your app code one of the `NSDocument` `revert...` methods than one of the `read...` methods. The `read...` methods are there primarily for you to override. The `revert(toContentsOf:ofType:)` method that is meant always to be invoked during rereading of an open document, sets the `fileModificationDate` property with the file’s modification date after it has been read.

### iCloud Support

The `NSDocument` class implements the file coordination support that is required for an iCloud-enabled, document-based Mac app (see How iCloud Document Storage Works in iCloud Design Guide). In addition, this class’s methods for moving and renaming documents, new in OS X v10.8, ensure that these operations are performed in a safe manner for iCloud-enabled apps.

### Multicore Considerations

In macOS 10.6 and later, `NSDocument` supports the ability to open multiple documents concurrently. However, this support requires the cooperation of the document object. If your document subclass is able to read specific document types independently of other similar documents, you should override the `canConcurrentlyReadDocuments(ofType:)` class method and return `true` for the appropriate document types. If specific document types rely on shared state information, however, you should return `false` for those types.

An object that manages an app’s documents.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSDocumentController

## Overview

As the first-responder target of New and Open menu commands, `NSDocumentController` creates and opens documents and tracks them throughout a session of the app. When opening documents, a document controller runs and manages the modal Open panel. `NSDocumentController` objects also maintain and manage the mappings of document types, extensions, and `NSDocument` subclasses as specified in the CFBundleDocumentTypes property loaded from the information property list ( `Info.plist`).

You can use various `NSDocumentController` methods to get a list of the current documents, get the current document (which is the document whose window is currently key), get documents based on a given filename or window, and find out about a document’s extension, type, display name, and document class.

In some situations, it’s worthwhile to subclass `NSDocumentController` in non- `NSDocument`-based apps to get some of its features. For example, the `NSDocumentController` management of the Open Recent menu is useful in apps that don’t use subclasses of `NSDocument`.

Class

# NSPersistentDocument

A document object that can integrate with Core Data.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSPersistentDocument

## Overview

The `NSPersistentDocument` class is a subclass of `NSDocument` that is designed to easily integrate into the Core Data framework. It provides methods to access a document-wide `NSManagedObjectContext` object, and provides default implementations of methods to read and write files using the persistence framework. In a persistent document, the undo manager functionality is taken over by managed object context.

Standard document behavior is implemented as follows:

- Opening a document invokes `configurePersistentStoreCoordinator(for:ofType:modelConfiguration:storeOptions:)` with the new URL, and adds a store of the default type (XML). Objects are loaded from the persistent store on demand through the document’s context.

- Saving a new document adds a store of the default type with the chosen URL and invokes save: on the context. For an existing document, a save just invokes `save()` on the context.

- Save As for a new document simply invokes save. For an opened document, it migrates the persistent store to the new URL and invokes `save()` on the context.

- Revert resets the document’s managed object context. Objects are subsequently loaded from the persistent store on demand, as with opening a new document.

By default an `NSPersistentDocument` instance creates its own ready-to-use persistence stack including managed object context, persistent object store coordinator and persistent store. There is a one-to-one mapping between the document and the backing object store.

You can customize the architecture of the persistence stack by overriding the `managedObjectModel` property and `configurePersistentStoreCoordinator(for:ofType:modelConfiguration:storeOptions:)` method. You might wish to do this, for example, to specify a particular managed object model.

### Undo Support

The persistent document uses the managed object context’s undo manager.

The `isDocumentEdited` method returns `true` if the persistent document’s managed object context, or editors registered with the context, have uncommitted changes, otherwise it returns `false`.

## Topics

### Managing the Persistence Objects

`var managedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext?`

The managed object context for the document.

`var managedObjectModel: NSManagedObjectModel?`

Configures the receiver’s persistent store coordinator with the appropriate stores for a given URL.

Returns the type of persistent store associated with the specified file type.

### Document Content Management

Sets the contents of the receiver by reading from a file of a given type located by a given URL.

`func revert(toContentsOf: URL, ofType: String) throws`

Overridden to clean up the managed object context and controllers during a revert.

`func write(to: URL, ofType: String, for: NSDocument.SaveOperationType, originalContentsURL: URL?) throws`

Class

# NSPasteboard

An object that transfers data to and from the pasteboard server.

macOS

class NSPasteboard

## Mentioned in

Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

## Overview

The pasteboard server is shared by all running apps. It contains data that the user has cut or copied, as well as other data that one application wants to transfer to another. `NSPasteboard` objects are an application’s sole interface to the server and to all pasteboard operations.

An `NSPasteboard` object is also used to transfer data between apps and service providers listed in each application’s Services menu. The drag pasteboard is used to transfer data that is being dragged by the user.

A pasteboard can contain multiple items. You can directly write or read any object that implements the `NSPasteboardWriting` or `NSPasteboardReading` Protocol respectively. This allows you to write and read common items such as URLs, colors, images, strings, attributed strings, and sounds without an intermediary object. Your custom classes can also implement these protocols for use with the pasteboard.

Writing methods such as `setData(_:forType:)` provide a convenient means of writing to the first pasteboard item, without having to create the first pasteboard item. You can use code like this, for example:

[pboard clearContents];
[pboard setData:data forType:type];

The general pasteboard, available by way of the `general` class method, automatically participates with the Universal Clipboard feature in macOS 10.12 and later and in iOS 10.0 and later. There is no macOS API for interacting with this feature.

- NSPasteboardItem

Class

# NSPasteboardItem

An item on a pasteboard.

class NSPasteboardItem

## Overview

There are three main uses for an `NSPasteboardItem` object:

- Providing data on the pasteboard.

You can create one or more pasteboard items, set data or data providers for types, and write them to the pasteboard.

- Customizing data already on the pasteboard.

As a delegate or subclass, you can retrieve the pasteboard items currently on the pasteboard, read the existing types and data, and set new data and data providers for types as necessary.

- Retrieving data from the pasteboard.

You can retrieve pasteboard items from the pasteboard and then read the data for types you’re interested in.

A pasteboard item can be associated with a single pasteboard. When you create an item, you can write it to any pasteboard. When you pass an item to a pasteboard in `writeObjects(_:)`, that item becomes bound to the pasteboard it writes to. When you retrieve items from a pasteboard using `pasteboardItems` or `readObjects(forClasses:options:)`, the returned items are associated with the messaged pasteboard. Passing an item that is already associated with a pasteboard into `writeObjects(_:)` causes an exception.

Use pasteboard items during a single pasteboard interaction, rather than retaining and reusing them. A pasteboard item is only valid until the owner of the pasteboard changes.

## Topics

### Getting types

[`var types: [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboarditem/types)

An array of uniform type identifier strings of the data types that the receiver supports.

Returns from a given array of types the first type within the pasteboard item, according to the ordering of types.

- Supporting Drag and Drop Through File Promises

Sample Code

# Supporting Drag and Drop Through File Promises

Receive and provide file promises to support dragged app files and pasteboard operations.

Download

Xcode 13.3+

## Overview

This sample code project creates a meme generator that combines an image and text into a composite meme image which can be exported as a JPEG. The sample shows you how to support both file URLs and file promises when accepting images from Mail, Safari, Photos, and other apps that support drag and drop. It also demonstrates how to provide file promises to other apps.

Your app may need to support file promises because drag and drop on macOS uses an NSPasteboard, which is separate from the normal copy-and-paste clipboard. When dragging content that isnʼt yet a file on disk at the time dragging began, an app may put a file promise onto the pasteboard instead of a file URL, to avoid blocking the main thread. File promises are different from URLs because they can be read and written asynchronously at a later time, on a background queue separate from the main queue. macOS Sierra introduced modern APIs to handle file promises.

### Configure the Sample Code Project

To see this sample in action, build and run the project, then drag an image from another app or location, such as Finder, Mail, or Safari, into the app window. Dragging the image into the window imports it into a form the sample app can parse and consume. Add text to the image by clicking on the text button in the upper-right corner and typing. Reposition the text box by dragging and dropping it within the app window. Dragging the composite image outside the app window exports it as a JPEG.

Below are the various ways a drag and drop can occur that will involve either a `NSFilePromiseProvider` or a `NSFilePromiseReceiver`.

Drag sent by `NSFilePromiseProvider`:

- Drag an image out to the Finder.

- Drag an image out to Mail.

- Drag an image out to Photos.

Drag received by `NSFilePromiseReceiver`:

- Drag an image in from Safari (from a website with a jpg, png, etc).

- Drag an image in from Photos.

- Drag in a very large photo from Photos app — helps test the progress UI when receiving large photos.

In addition, a drag and drop involves just the image file’s URL, without a file promise:

- Drag an image from Finder.

- Drag an image from a Mail attachment.

### Support Image Import by Accepting File Promises

When setting up the view that supports drag and drop, register drag types provided by `NSFilePromiseReceiver`. This registration allows the view to accept file promises that handle dragged images from Safari or Mail. The sample does this in the first view controller’s `viewDidLoad`.

view.registerForDraggedTypes(NSFilePromiseReceiver.readableDraggedTypes.map { NSPasteboard.PasteboardType($0) })

Handle file promises before handling URLs, because the file promise generally represents the higher-quality image and should take precedence when both types are supported. This sample provides a background operation queue, so the read/write operation doesn’t block the main thread. Until the file promise is fulfilled, this sample shows a spinner or loading indicator in the image view subclass to give the user immediate feedback that the app is processing the drop.

case let filePromiseReceiver as NSFilePromiseReceiver:
self.prepareForUpdate()
filePromiseReceiver.receivePromisedFiles(atDestination: self.destinationURL, options: [:],
operationQueue: self.workQueue) { (fileURL, error) in
if let error = error {
self.handleError(error)
} else {
self.handleFile(at: fileURL)
}
}

This sample continues to handle file URLs, in case the app from which a user drags the image doesn’t provide file promises.

case let fileURL as URL:
self.handleFile(at: fileURL)

### Support Image Export by Providing File Promises

This sample creates and writes images into formats that other apps like Safari, Mail, and Finder can consume. It does this by providing an `NSFilePromiseProvider` instance to the dragging pasteboard and conforming to `NSFilePromiseProviderDelegate` by implementing three delegate methods.

This sample uses the first method to provide the title of the file. It uses a hard-coded string for simplicity, but depending on use case, take the `fileType` parameter into account.

let droppedFileName = NSLocalizedString("DropFileTitle", comment: "")
return droppedFileName + ".jpg"
}

This sample provides a background operation queue in `operationQueue(for:)` so the file reading and writing happen without blocking the app’s UI. This method is optional, but defaulting to the main queue can block an app’s UI for writing large files to disk. When possible, provide a background queue.

return workQueue
}

The third delegate method performs the actual writing of the file to disk when it’s time to fulfill the file promise. Add custom logic necessary to transform the image from your app into a file format that other apps are likely to understand, such as the JPEG format this sample uses.

do {
if let snapshot = filePromiseProvider.userInfo as? ImageCanvas.SnapshotItem {
try snapshot.jpegRepresentation?.write(to: url)
} else {
throw RuntimeError.unavailableSnapshot
}
completionHandler(nil)
} catch let error {
completionHandler(error)
}
}

# Supporting Table View Drag and Drop Through File Promises

Share data between macOS apps during drag and drop by using an item provider.

Download

Xcode 13.1+

## Overview

A file promise is a possible future file sent by an app of a specified type. When working with drag and drop, use file promises to indicate intent for a future drag operation. The future drag operation promises the delivery of the file at drop time. This avoids loading or performing any actions on the file until the promise completes. Use the `NSFilePromiseProvider` class when creating file promises. Use the `NSFilePromiseReceiver` to receive file promises.

Implement drag and drop with an `NSTableView` by using a dragging pasteboard. When a drag starts, you adopt the `NSPasteboardWriting` protocol to write data to the `NSPasteboard`. When a drag occurs, you determine the valid drop target. When the drag ends, you read the drag data from the `NSPasteboard`. Adopt `NSTableViewDataSource` to handle with these drag operations.

### Display Files to Drag and Drop

This sample code project displays a list of image files from the Pictures folder found in the user’s home directory. It allows those pictures to be dragged within the table view, to be reordered, and dragged out to be copied to other apps. Pictures are also dragged in from other apps like Finder, Mail, Safari, and Photos.

The sample shows how to support both `URL` and file promises drags when accepting images from Mail, Safari, Photos, and other apps that support drag and drop. It also demonstrates how to provide file promises to other apps.

### Test Drag and Drop by Creating or Receiving File Promises

To see this sample in action, build and run the project, then drag an image from another app or location, such as Finder, Mail, Photos or Safari, into the app’s window. Dragging the image into the window imports it into a form that the sample app can parse and consume. There are multiple ways to drag and drop image files to and from the sample app. The way a user drags a file determines how files are promised to and from the destination. If the user drags an image file from the app to the Finder, the Finder uses the `NSFilePromiseProvider` to make a copy. If the user drags a photo from Photos, the sample app uses `NSFilePromiseReceiver` to receive a copy.

Below are the various ways a drag and drop can occur that will involve either a `NSFilePromiseProvider` or a `NSFilePromiseReceiver`.

Drag sent by `NSFilePromiseProvider`:

- Drag an image out to the Finder.

- Drag an image out to Mail.

- Drag an image out to Photos.

Drag received by `NSFilePromiseReceiver`:

- Drag an image in from Safari (from a website with a jpg, png, etc).

- Drag an image in from Photos.

- Drag multiple images in from Photos — helps test receiving multiple file promises.

- Drag in a very large photo from Photos app — helps test the progress UI when receiving large photos.

In addition, a drag and drop involves just the image file’s URL, without a file promise:

- Drag an image from Finder.

- Drag an image from a Mail attachment.

This sample app also supports drag and drop of images from within the table view that don’t involve a URL. In this case photos are re-ordered using the row number of the photo as the drag reference.

### Support Image Import by Accepting File Promises

When setting up the table view to support drag and drop, register drag pasteboard types to the table view. This sample registers three pasteboard types. `NSFilePromiseReceiver` provides the first. This type allows the table view to accept file promises that handle dragged images from apps like Safari or Photos. The second, `.fileURL`, accepts drags as file URLs. The third type is `itemDragType`, a custom pasteboard type that accepts table view cell rows to drag within the table view.

The sample registers these pasteboard types in the view controller’s `viewDidLoad` function:

tableView.registerForDraggedTypes(
NSFilePromiseReceiver.readableDraggedTypes.map { NSPasteboard.PasteboardType($0) })

tableView.registerForDraggedTypes([\
.fileURL, // Accept dragging of image file URLs from other apps.\
.rowDragType]) // Intra drag of row items numbers within the table.

Handle file promises before handling file URLs, because the file promise generally represents the higher-quality image and should take precedence when both types are supported. Provide a background operation queue so the read-and-write operation doesn’t block the main thread. Until the file promise is fulfilled, this app shows a spinning indicator to give the user immediate feedback that the app is processing the drop. Continue to handle file URLs, in case the app from which the user drags the image doesn’t provide file promises.

var handled = false
if let promises = draggingInfo.draggingPasteboard.readObjects(forClasses: [NSFilePromiseReceiver.self], options: nil) {
if !promises.isEmpty {
// We have incoming drag item(s) that are file promises.

// At the start of insertion(s), clear the current table view selection.
tableView.deselectAll(self)

for promise in promises {
if let promiseReceiver = promise as? NSFilePromiseReceiver {
// Show the progress indicator as we start receiving this promised file.
progressIndicator.isHidden = false
progressIndicator.startAnimation(self)

// Ask our file promise receiver to fulfull on their promise.
promiseReceiver.receivePromisedFiles(atDestination: destinationURL,
options: [:],
operationQueue: filePromiseQueue) { (fileURL, error) in
/** Finished copying the promised file.
Back on the main thread, insert the newly created image file into the table view.
*/
OperationQueue.main.addOperation {
if error != nil {
self.reportURLError(fileURL, error: error!)
} else {
_ = self.insertURL(fileURL, toRow: toRow)

/** Select the newly inserted photo,
extend the selection so to accumulate multiple selected photos.
*/
let indexSet = IndexSet(integer: toRow)
self.tableView.selectRowIndexes(indexSet, byExtendingSelection: true)
}
// Stop the progress indicator as we are done receiving this promised file.
self.progressIndicator.isHidden = true
self.progressIndicator.stopAnimation(self)
}
}
}
}
handled = true
}
}
return handled
}

### Support Image Export by Providing File Promises

To write images from the table view, the sample app creates formats that other apps like Safari, Mail, and Finder can consume, write an `NSFilePromiseProvider` instance to the dragging pasteboard, and conform to `NSFilePromiseProviderDelegate` by implementing three delegate functions.

Use the first function to provide the title of the file to be promised. This sample uses the last component of the photo item’s `fileURL` to determine the promised file name.

// Return the photoItem's URL file name.
let photoItem = photoFromFilePromiserProvider(filePromiseProvider: filePromiseProvider)
return (photoItem?.fileURL.lastPathComponent)!
}

Provide a background operation queue in `operationQueue(for:)`, so the file write happens without blocking the app’s UI. This function is optional, but defaulting to the main queue will block the app’s UI for writing large files to disk. When possible, provide a background queue.

return filePromiseQueue
}

The third delegate function performs the actual writing of the file to disk when it is time to fulfill the file promise. Add custom logic necessary to transform the image from the app into a file format that other apps are likely to understand, such as the image formats that this sample uses.

func filePromiseProvider(_ filePromiseProvider: NSFilePromiseProvider,
writePromiseTo url: URL,

do {
if let photoItem = photoFromFilePromiserProvider(filePromiseProvider: filePromiseProvider) {
/** Copy the file to the location provided to us. We always do a copy, not a move.
It's important you call the completion handler.
*/
try FileManager.default.copyItem(at: photoItem.fileURL, to: url)
}
completionHandler(nil)
} catch let error {
OperationQueue.main.addOperation {
self.presentError(error, modalFor: self.view.window!,
delegate: nil, didPresent: nil, contextInfo: nil)
}
completionHandler(error)
}
}

Implement `NSTableViewDelegate` `tableView(_:pasteboardWriterForRow:)` so the table view uses the file promise provider when the image files are dragged out. It returns an instance of `NSPasteboardItem` or a custom object that implements the `NSPasteboardWriting` protocol.

/** Return a custom NSFilePromiseProvider.
Here we provide a custom provider, offering the row to the drag object, and it's URL.
*/
var provider: FilePromiseProvider

let photoItem = contentArray[row]
let photoFileExtension = photoItem.fileURL.pathExtension

if #available(macOS 11.0, *) {
let typeIdentifier = UTType(filenameExtension: photoFileExtension)
provider = FilePromiseProvider(fileType: typeIdentifier!.identifier, delegate: self)
} else {
let typeIdentifier =
UTTypeCreatePreferredIdentifierForTag(kUTTagClassFilenameExtension, photoFileExtension as CFString, nil)
provider = FilePromiseProvider(fileType: typeIdentifier!.takeRetainedValue() as String, delegate: self)
}

// Send over the row number and photo's url dictionary.
provider.userInfo = [FilePromiseProvider.UserInfoKeys.rowNumberKey: row,\
FilePromiseProvider.UserInfoKeys.urlKey: photoItem.fileURL as Any]
return provider
}

Returning a non-nil value will make the table view cell draggable. To drag image files from the table view to other apps, the table view’s drag operation mask is set by the table view’s view controller to work outside the app using `setDraggingSourceOperationMask(_:forLocal:)`.

tableView.setDraggingSourceOperationMask(.copy, forLocal: false)

### Validate the Table Drop

To allow the table view to determine a valid drop target, implement `tableView(_:validateDrop:proposedRow:proposedDropOperation:)`. UIKit calls this delegate function when a drag is moved over the table view and before the dragging object is dropped by the user. Specify how to respond to a proposed drop operation, which will be either on or above a cell. In this sample, users can drop items between cells to insert them.

### Accept the Drop onto the Table

To allow the table view to accept the drop when the user releases the mouse button over it, implement this delegate function `tableView(_:acceptDrop:row:dropOperation:)`.

func tableView(_ tableView: NSTableView,
acceptDrop info: NSDraggingInfo,
row: Int,

// Check where the dragged items are coming.
if dragSourceIsFromOurTable(draggingInfo: info) {
/** Drag source came from our own table view.
Move each dragged photo item to their new place.
*/
dropInternalPhotos(tableView, draggingInfo: info, toRow: row)
} else {
/** The drop source is from another app (Finder, Mail, Safari, etc.) and there may be more than one file.
Drop each dragged image file to their new place.
*/
dropExternalPhotos(tableView, draggingInfo: info, toRow: row)
}
return true
}

This function handles the data from the dragging pasteboard after the user drops the image onto the table view.

### Drag and Drop to Reorder Table Rows

To reorder image files within the table view, the sample app defines and registers a custom pasteboard type:

extension NSPasteboard.PasteboardType {
static let rowDragType = NSPasteboard.PasteboardType("com.mycompany.mydragdrop")
}

When using that custom pasteboard type, the user then drags and drops images within the table view to be reordered:

func dropInternalPhotos(_ tableView: NSTableView, draggingInfo: NSDraggingInfo, toRow: Int) {
var indexesToMove = IndexSet()

draggingInfo.enumerateDraggingItems(
options: NSDraggingItemEnumerationOptions.concurrent,
for: tableView,
classes: [NSPasteboardItem.self],
searchOptions: [:],
using: {(draggingItem, idx, stop) in
if let pasteboardItem = draggingItem.item as? NSPasteboardItem,
let photoRow = pasteboardItem.propertyList(forType: .rowDragType) as? Int {
indexesToMove.insert(photoRow)
}
})

// Move/drop the photos in their correct place using their indexes.
moveObjectsFromIndexes(indexesToMove, toIndex: toRow)

// Set the selected rows to those that were just moved.
let rowsMovedDown = rowsMovedDownward(toRow, indexSet: indexesToMove)
let selectionRange = toRow - rowsMovedDown..<toRow - rowsMovedDown + indexesToMove.count
let indexSet = IndexSet(integersIn: selectionRange)
tableView.selectRowIndexes(indexSet, byExtendingSelection: false)
}

A file promise is a possible future file sent by an app of a specified type. When working with drag and drop, use file promises to indicate intent for a future drag operation. The future drag operation promises the delivery of the file at drop time. This avoids loading or performing any actions on the file until the promise completes. Use the `NSFilePromiseProvider` class when creating file promises. Use the `NSFilePromiseReceiver` to receive file promises.

Implement drag and drop with an `NSCollectionView` by using a dragging pasteboard. When a drag starts, you adopt the `NSPasteboardWriting` protocol to write data to the `NSPasteboard`. When a drag occurs, you determine the valid drop target. When the drag ends, you read the drag data from the `NSPasteboard`. Adopt `NSCollectionViewDelegate` to handle with these drag operations.

### Display Files to Drag and Drop

This sample code project displays a list of image files from the Pictures folder found in the user’s home directory. It allows those pictures to be dragged within the collection view, to be reordered, and dragged out to be copied to other apps. Pictures are also dragged in from other apps like Finder, Mail, Safari, and Photos.

The sample shows how to support both `URL` and file promises drags when accepting images from Mail, Safari, Photos, and other apps that support drag and drop. It also demonstrates how to provide file promises to other apps.

### Test Drag and Drop by Creating or Receiving File Promises

To see this sample in action, build and run the project, then drag an image from another app or location, such as Finder, Mail, Photos or Safari, into the app’s window. Dragging the image into the window imports it into a form the sample app can parse and consume. There are multiple ways to drag and drop image files to and from the sample app. The way a user drags a file determines how files are promised to and from the destination. If the user drags an image file from the app to the Finder, the Finder uses the `NSFilePromiseProvider` to make a copy. If the user drags a photo from Photos, the sample app uses `NSFilePromiseReceiver` to receive a copy.

Below are the various ways drag and drop can occur that will involve either a `NSFilePromiseProvider` or a `NSFilePromiseReceiver`.

Drag sent by `NSFilePromiseProvider`:

- Drag an image out to the Finder.

- Drag an image out to Mail.

- Drag an image out to Photos.

Drag received by `NSFilePromiseReceiver`:

- Drag an image in from Safari (from a website with a jpg, png, etc).

- Drag an image in from Photos.

- Drag multiple images in from Photos — to test receiving multiple file promises.

- Drag in a very large photo from Photos app — to test the progress UI when receiving large photos.

In addition, a drag and drop involves just the image file’s URL, without a file promise:

- Drag an image from Finder.

- Drag an image from a Mail attachment.

This sample app also supports drag and drop of images from within the collection view that don’t involve a URL. In this case photos are re-ordered using the index path of the photo as the drag reference.

### Support Image Import by Accepting File Promises

When setting up the collection view to support drag and drop, register drag pasteboard types to the collection view. This sample registers three pasteboard types. `NSFilePromiseReceiver` provides the first. This type allows the collection view to accept file promises that handle dragged images from apps like Safari or Photos. The second, `.fileURL`, accepts drags as file URLs. The third type is `itemDragType`, a custom pasteboard type that accepts collection view cell items to drag within the collection view.

The sample registers these pasteboard types in the view controller’s `viewDidLoad` function:

collectionView.registerForDraggedTypes(
NSFilePromiseReceiver.readableDraggedTypes.map { NSPasteboard.PasteboardType($0) })

collectionView.registerForDraggedTypes([\
.fileURL, // Accept dragging of image file URLs from other apps.\
.itemDragType]) // Intra drag of row items numbers within the collection view.

Handle file promises before handling file URLs, because the file promise generally represents the higher-quality image and should take precedence when both types are supported. Provide a background-operation queue so the read-and-write operation doesn’t block the main thread. Until the file promise is fulfilled, this app shows a spinning indicator to give the user immediate feedback that the app is processing the drop. Continue to handle file URLs, in case the app from which the user drags the image doesn’t provide file promises.

var handled = false
if let promises = draggingInfo.draggingPasteboard.readObjects(forClasses: [NSFilePromiseReceiver.self], options: nil) {
if !promises.isEmpty {
// We have incoming drag items that are file promises.
for promise in promises {
if let promiseReceiver = promise as? NSFilePromiseReceiver {
// Show the progress indicator as we start receiving this promised file.
progressIndicator.isHidden = false
progressIndicator.startAnimation(self)

// Ask your file promise receiver to fulfill on their promise.
promiseReceiver.receivePromisedFiles(atDestination: destinationURL, options: [:],
operationQueue: self.filePromiseQueue) { (fileURL, error) in
/** Finished copying the promised file.
Back on the main thread, insert the newly created image file into the table view.
*/
OperationQueue.main.addOperation {
if error != nil {
self.reportURLError(fileURL, error: error!)
} else {
_ = self.insertURL(fileURL, toIndexPath: toIndexPath)
}
// Stop the progress indicator as you are done receiving this promised file.
self.progressIndicator.isHidden = true
self.progressIndicator.stopAnimation(self)
}
}
}
}
handled = true
}
}
return handled
}

### Support Image Export by Providing File Promises

To write images from the collection view, the sample app creates formats that other apps like Safari, Mail, and Finder can consume, write an `NSFilePromiseProvider` instance to the dragging pasteboard, and conform to `NSFilePromiseProviderDelegate` by implementing three delegate functions.

Use the first function to provide the title of the file to be promised. This sample uses the last component of the photo item’s `fileURL` to determine the promised file name.

// Return the photoItem's URL file name.
let photoItem = photoFromFilePromiserProvider(filePromiseProvider: filePromiseProvider)
return (photoItem?.fileURL.lastPathComponent)!
}

Provide a background operation queue in `operationQueue(for:)`, so the file write happens without blocking the app’s UI. This function is optional, but defaulting to the main queue will block the app’s UI for writing large files to disk. When possible, provide a background queue.

return filePromiseQueue
}

The third delegate function performs the actual writing of the file to disk when it is time to fulfill the file promise. Add custom logic necessary to transform the image from the app into a file format that other apps are likely to understand, such as the image formats that this sample uses.

func filePromiseProvider(_ filePromiseProvider: NSFilePromiseProvider,
writePromiseTo url: URL,

do {
if let photoItem = photoFromFilePromiserProvider(filePromiseProvider: filePromiseProvider) {
/** Copy the file to the location provided to you. You always do a copy, not a move.
It's important you call the completion handler.
*/
try FileManager.default.copyItem(at: photoItem.fileURL, to: url)
}
completionHandler(nil)
} catch let error {
OperationQueue.main.addOperation {
self.presentError(error, modalFor: self.view.window!,
delegate: nil, didPresent: nil, contextInfo: nil)
}
completionHandler(error)
}
}

Implement `NSCollectionViewDelegate` `collectionView(_:pasteboardWriterForItemAt:)` so the collection view uses the file promise provider when the image files are dragged out. It returns a custom instance of `NSFilePromiseProvider` implements the `NSPasteboardWriting` protocol.

func collectionView(_ collectionView: NSCollectionView,

/** Here the sample provide a custom NSFilePromise#imageLiteral(resourceName: "_DSC9930.jpeg")#imageLiteral(resourceName: "_DSC9930.jpeg")Provider.
Here we provide a custom provider, offering the row to the drag object, and its URL.
*/
var provider: NSFilePromiseProvider?

guard let photoItem =
dataSource.itemIdentifier(for: IndexPath(item: indexPath.item, section: 0)) else { return provider }
let photoFileExtension = photoItem.fileURL.pathExtension

if #available(macOS 11.0, *) {
let typeIdentifier = UTType(filenameExtension: photoFileExtension)
provider = FilePromiseProvider(fileType: typeIdentifier!.identifier, delegate: self)
} else {
let typeIdentifier =
UTTypeCreatePreferredIdentifierForTag(kUTTagClassFilenameExtension, photoFileExtension as CFString, nil)
provider = FilePromiseProvider(fileType: typeIdentifier!.takeRetainedValue() as String, delegate: self)
}

// Send out the indexPath and photo's url dictionary.
do {
let data = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: indexPath, requiringSecureCoding: false)
provider!.userInfo = [FilePromiseProvider.UserInfoKeys.urlKey: photoItem.fileURL as Any,\
FilePromiseProvider.UserInfoKeys.indexPathKey: data]
} catch {
fatalError("failed to archive indexPath to pasteboard")
}
return provider
}

Returning a non-nil value will make the collection view cell draggable. To drag image files from the collection view to other apps, the collection view’s drag operation mask is set by the collection view’s view controller to work outside the app using `setDraggingSourceOperationMask(_:forLocal:)`.

collectionView.setDraggingSourceOperationMask([.copy, .delete], forLocal: false)

### Validate the Collection Drop

To allow the collection view to determine a valid drop target, implement `collectionView(_:validateDrop:proposedIndex:dropOperation:)`. UIKit calls this delegate function when a drag is moved over the collection view and before the dragging object is dropped by the user. Specify how to respond to a proposed drop operation, which will be either on or above a cell. In this sample, users can drop items between cells to insert them.

### Accept the Drop onto the Collection View

To allow the collection view to accept the drop when the user releases the mouse button over it, implement this delegate function `collectionView(_:acceptDrop:index:dropOperation:)`.

func collectionView(_ collectionView: NSCollectionView,
acceptDrop draggingInfo: NSDraggingInfo,
indexPath: IndexPath,

// Check where the dragged items are coming from.
if let draggingSource = draggingInfo.draggingSource as? NSCollectionView, draggingSource == collectionView {
// Drag source from your own collection view.
// Move each dragged photo item to their new place.
dropInternalPhotos(collectionView, draggingInfo: draggingInfo, indexPath: indexPath)
} else {
// The drop source is from another app (Finder, Mail, Safari, etc.) and there may be more than one file.
// Drop each dragged image file to their new place.
dropExternalPhotos(collectionView, draggingInfo: draggingInfo, indexPath: indexPath)
}
return true
}

This function handles the data from the dragging pasteboard after the user drops the image onto the collection view.

### Drag and Drop to Reorder Collection Items

To reorder image files within the collection view, the sample app defines and registers a custom pasteboard type:

extension NSPasteboard.PasteboardType {
static let itemDragType = NSPasteboard.PasteboardType("com.mycompany.mydragdrop")
}

When using that custom pasteboard type, the user then drags and drops images within the collection view to be reordered:

func dropInternalPhotos(_ collectionView: NSCollectionView, draggingInfo: NSDraggingInfo, indexPath: IndexPath) {
var snapshot = self.dataSource.snapshot()

draggingInfo.enumerateDraggingItems(
options: NSDraggingItemEnumerationOptions.concurrent,
for: collectionView,
classes: [NSPasteboardItem.self],
searchOptions: [:],
using: {(draggingItem, idx, stop) in
if let pasteboardItem = draggingItem.item as? NSPasteboardItem {
do {
if let indexPathData = pasteboardItem.data(forType: .itemDragType), let photoIndexPath =
try NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(indexPathData) as? IndexPath {
if let photoItem = self.dataSource.itemIdentifier(for: photoIndexPath) {
// Find out the proper indexPath drop point.
let toIndexPath = self.dropLocation(indexPath: indexPath)

let dropItemLocation = snapshot.itemIdentifiers[toIndexPath.item]
if toIndexPath.item == 0 {
// Item is being dropped at the beginning.
snapshot.moveItem(photoItem, beforeItem: dropItemLocation)
} else {
// Item is being dropped between items or at the very end.
snapshot.moveItem(photoItem, afterItem: dropItemLocation)
}
}
}
} catch {
Swift.debugPrint("failed to unarchive indexPath for dropped photo item.")
}
}
})
dataSource.apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: true)
}

# NSFilePromiseProvider

class NSFilePromiseProvider

## Overview

A file promise is a possible future file of a specified type. When you’re working with drag and drop, use promises to indicate intent for future action. Avoid loading or performing any actions on the file until the promise completes.

Use the `NSFilePromiseProvider` class when creating file promises. Instantiate one `NSFilePromiseProvider` for each file promised. Set the `fileType` and `delegate` properties before writing any `NSFilePromiseProvider` to the pasteboard. The file type must be a Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) that ultimately conforms to `kUTTypeData` or `kUTTypeDirectory`. The `NSFilePromiseProviderDelegate` will write the promised file to the destination directory.

Optionally, you may attach a `userInfo` object of your choosing to the `NSFilePromiseProvider` to determine which promise is being referenced when promising multiple files under the same `NSFilePromiseProviderDelegate` instance.

## Topics

draggingInfo.enumerateDraggingItems(options: [], for: view, classes: [NSFilePromiseReceiver.self], searchOptions: [:], using: {(draggingItem, idx, stop) in
let filePromiseReceiver = draggingItem.item
// Use filePromiseReceiver here for your task.

# NSViewAnimation

An animation of an app’s views, limited to changes in frame location and size, and to fade-in and fade-out effects.

macOS

class NSViewAnimation

## Overview

An `NSViewAnimation` object takes an array of dictionaries from which it determines the objects to animate and the effects to apply to them. Each dictionary must have a target object and, optionally, properties that specify beginning and ending frame and whether to fade in or fade out. (See `NSViewAnimation.Key` for further information.) Animations with `NSViewAnimation` are, by default, in non-blocking mode over a duration of 0.5 seconds using the ease in-out animation curve. But you can configure the animation to have any duration, curve, frame rate, and blocking mode. You may also set progress marks, assign a delegate, and implement delegation methods in order to animate view and windows concurrent with the ones specified as targets in the view-animation dictionary.

Invoking the `NSAnimation` `stop()` method on a running `NSViewAnimation` object moves the animation to the end frame.

# NSAnimatablePropertyContainer

A set of methods that defines a way to add animation to an existing class with a minimum of API impact.

protocol NSAnimatablePropertyContainer

## Overview

The `NSAnimatablePropertyContainer` protocol returns a proxy object for the receiver that can be used to initiate implied animation of property changes. An object’s animator proxy should be treated as if it was the object itself, and may be passed to any code that accepts the object as a parameter. Sending of key-value-coding compliant “set” messages to the proxy will trigger animation for automatically animated properties of its target object.

An object’s automatically animated properties are those for which `NSAnimatablePropertyContainer` finds and returns a `CAAnimation` object instead of `nil`, often because `animator()` specifies a default animation for the key.

It’s perfectly valid to set a new value for a property for which an animation that is currently in progress; this simply sets a new target value for that property, with animation to the new target proceeding from whatever current value the property has reached. An in-flight property animation can be stopped by setting a new value for the property bracketed by an `NSAnimationContext` with 0.0 as the duration.

## Overview

`NSAnimationContext` is analogous to `CATransaction` and is similar in overall concept to `NSGraphicsContext`. Each thread maintains its own stack of nestable `NSAnimationContext` instances, with each new instance initialized as a copy of the instance below (so, inheriting its current properties).

Multiple `NSAnimationContext` instances can be nested, allowing a given block of code to initiate animations using its own specified duration without affecting animations initiated by surrounding code.

[NSAnimationContext beginGrouping];
// Animate enclosed operations with a duration of 1 second
[[NSAnimationContext currentContext] setDuration:1.0];
[[aView animator] setFrame:newFrame];
...
[NSAnimationContext beginGrouping];
// Animate alpha fades with half-second duration
[[NSAnimationContext currentContext] setDuration:0.5];
[[aView animator] setAlphaValue:0.75];
[[bView animator] setAlphaValue:0.75];
[NSAnimationContext endGrouping];
...
// Will animate with a duration of 1 second
[[bView animator] setFrame:secondFrame];
[NSAnimationContext endGrouping];

Protocol

# NSViewControllerPresentationAnimator

A set of methods that let you define animations to play when transitioning between two view controllers.

macOS

protocol NSViewControllerPresentationAnimator : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Implement this protocol only if you want to provide custom animations. You might find what you need in the `NSViewController.TransitionOptions` enumeration, which provides many predefined animations.

A class that adopts this protocol is responsible for both presenting and dismissing a view controller.

## Topics

### Animating Presentation and Dismissal of View Controllers

`func animatePresentation(of: NSViewController, from: NSViewController)`

Called when the specified view controller is about to be presented.

**Required**

`func animateDismissal(of: NSViewController, from: NSViewController)`

Called when a previously-presented view controller is about to be dismissed.

Class

# NSLayoutConstraint

The relationship between two user interface objects that must be satisfied by the constraint-based layout system.

class NSLayoutConstraint

## Overview

Each constraint is a linear equation with the following format:

item1.attribute1 = multiplier × item2.attribute2 + constant

In this equation, `attribute1` and `attribute2` are the variables that Auto Layout can adjust when solving these constraints. The other values are defined when you create the constraint. For example, If you’re defining the relative position of two buttons, you might say “the leading edge of the second button should be 8 points after the trailing edge of the first button.” The linear equation for this relationship is shown below:

// positive values move to the right in left-to-right languages like English.
button2.leading = 1.0 × button1.trailing + 8.0

Auto Layout then modifies the values of the specified leading and trailing edges until both sides of the equation are equal. Note that Auto Layout does not simply assign the value of the right side of this equation to the left side. Instead, the system can modify either attribute or both attributes as needed to solve for this constraint.

The fact that constraints are equations (and not assignment operators) means that you can switch the order of the items in the equation as needed to more clearly express the desired relationship. However, if you switch the order, you must also invert the multiplier and constant. For example, the following two equations produce identical constraints:

// These equations produce identical constraints
button2.leading = 1.0 × button1.trailing + 8.0
button1.trailing = 1.0 × button2.leading - 8.0

A valid layout is defined as a set constraints with one and only one possible solution. Valid layouts are also referred to as a nonambiguous, nonconflicting layouts. Constraints with more than one solution are ambiguous. Constraints with no valid solutions are conflicting. For more information on resolving ambiguous and conflicting constraints, see Types of Errors in Auto Layout Guide.

After solving for the required constraints, Auto Layout tries to solve all the optional constraints in priority order from highest to lowest. If it cannot solve for an optional constraint, it tries to come as close as possible to the desired result, and then moves on to the next constraint.

This combination of inequalities, equalities, and priorities gives you a great amount of flexibility and power. By combining multiple constraints, you can define layouts that dynamically adapt as the size and location of the elements in your user interface change. For some example layouts, see Stack Views in Auto Layout Guide.

Class

# NSLayoutGuide

A rectangular area that can interact with Auto Layout.

class NSLayoutGuide

## Overview

Use layout guides to replace the placeholder views you may have created to represent inter-view spaces or encapsulation in your user interface. Traditionally, there were a number of Auto Layout techniques that required placeholder views. A placeholder view is an empty view that does not have any visual elements of its own and serves only to define a rectangular region in the view hierarchy. For example, if you wanted to use constraints to define the size or location of an empty space between views, you needed to use a placeholder view to represent that space. If you wanted to center a group of objects, you needed a placeholder view to contain those objects. Similarly, placeholder views could be used to contain and encapsulate part of your user interface. Placeholder views let you break up a large, complex user interface into self-contained, modular chunks. When used properly, they could greatly simplify your Auto Layout constraint logic.

There are a number of costs associated with adding placeholder views to your view hierarchy. First, there is the cost of creating and maintaining the view itself. Second, the placeholder view is a full member of the view hierarchy, which means that it adds overhead to every task the hierarchy performs. Worst of all, the invisible placeholder view can intercept messages that are intended for other views, causing problems that are very difficult to find.

The `NSLayoutGuide` class is designed to perform all the tasks previously performed by placeholder views, but to do it in a safer, more efficient manner. Layout guides are not views. They do not use as much memory, and they do not participate in the view hierarchy. Instead, they simply define a rectangular region in their owning view’s coordinate system that can interact with Auto Layout.

### Creating Layout Guides

To create a layout guide, perform the following steps:

1. Instantiate a new layout guide.

2. Add the layout guide to a view by calling the view’s `addLayoutGuide(_:)` method .

3. Define the position and size of the layout guide using Auto Layout.

You can use these guides to define the space between elements in your layout. The following example shows how to use layout guides to define an equal spacing between a series of views.

let space1 = NSLayoutGuide()
view.addLayoutGuide(space1)

let space2 = NSLayoutGuide()
view.addLayoutGuide(space2)

space1.widthAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space2.widthAnchor).active = true
saveButton.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space1.leadingAnchor).active = true
cancelButton.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space1.trailingAnchor).active = true
cancelButton.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space2.leadingAnchor).active = true
clearButton.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space2.trailingAnchor).active = true

NSLayoutGuide *space1 = [[NSLayoutGuide alloc]init];
[self.view addLayoutGuide:space1];

NSLayoutGuide *space2 = [[NSLayoutGuide alloc] init];
[self.view addLayoutGuide:space2];

[space1.widthAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space2.widthAnchor].active = YES;
[self.saveButton.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space1.leadingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.cancelButton.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space1.trailingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.cancelButton.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space2.leadingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.clearButton.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space2.trailingAnchor].active = YES;

A layout guide can also act as an opaque box that contains other views and controls, letting you encapsulate parts of your view and break up your layout into modular chunks.

let container = NSLayoutGuide()
view.addLayoutGuide(container)

// Layout the contents of the container
button.lastBaselineAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(textField.lastBaselineAnchor).active = true
button.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.leadingAnchor).active = true
textField.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(button.trailingAnchor, constant: 8.0).active = true
textField.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.trailingAnchor).active = true
textField.topAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.topAnchor).active = true
textField.bottomAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.bottomAnchor).active = true

// Set exterior constraints.
container.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(margins.leadingAnchor).active = true
container.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(margins.trailingAnchor).asctive = true
container.topAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(margins.topAnchor).active = true

NSLayoutGuide *container = [[NSLayoutGuide alloc] init];
[self.view addLayoutGuide:container];

// Layout the contents of the container
[self.button.lastBaselineAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.textField.lastBaselineAnchor].active = YES;
[self.textField.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.button.trailingAnchor constant:8.0].active = YES;
[self.textField.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:container.trailingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.textField.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:container.topAnchor].active = YES;
[self.textField.bottomAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:container.bottomAnchor].active = YES;

// Set exterior constraints.

[container.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.leadingAnchor constant:20.0].active = YES;
[container.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.trailingAnchor constant:20.0].active = YES;
[container.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.topAnchor constant:20.0].active = YES;

- Integrating a Toolbar and Touch Bar into Your App

Sample Code

# Integrating a Toolbar and Touch Bar into Your App

Provide users quick access to your app’s features from a toolbar and corresponding Touch Bar.

Download

Xcode 12.0+

## Overview

The _toolbar_ appears in the space immediately below or next to a window’s title bar and above the app’s content. You use an `NSToolbar` object to manage the items that appear in a toolbar, which are `NSToolbarItem` objects created in Interface Builder or source code.

This sample shows you how to add a toolbar to a window and add Touch Bar support that works in conjunction with the toolbar.

### Add the Toolbar

The sample defines the custom class `WindowController`, which derives from `NSWindowController` and conforms to the `NSToolbarDelegate` protocol. In Interface Builder, the sample creates an instance of `WindowController` in the Window Controller Scene of `Main.storyboard`, and adds an `NSToolbar` object to the `window` referenced by the controller. Then the sample connects the toolbar’s `delegate` to the `WindowController` instance.

The window controller also defines an outlet variable `toolbar`, making it possible to reference the toolbar instance in the source code of `WindowController.swift`.

@IBOutlet weak var toolbar: NSToolbar!

### Create Toolbar Item Identifiers

Each `NSToolbarItem` object has a unique identifier of type `NSToolbarItem.Identifier`. AppKit provides identifiers for standard toolbar items such as cloud sharing, printing, and showing the font and color palette. For custom toolbar items, the app provides the identifiers. For example, the sample provides two identifiers for its custom toolbar items: one for setting the font size and one for setting the font style of an `NSTextView`.

private extension NSToolbarItem.Identifier {
static let fontSize: NSToolbarItem.Identifier = NSToolbarItem.Identifier(rawValue: "FontSize")
static let fontStyle: NSToolbarItem.Identifier = NSToolbarItem.Identifier(rawValue: "FontStyle")
}

### Specify Allowed Toolbar Items

To tell the toolbar which items are available, the sample’s toolbar delegate implements the `toolbarAllowedItemIdentifiers(_:)` method, which returns an array of item identifiers. The available items appear in the toolbar’s customization palette for customizing the toolbar when running the sample app.

return [ NSToolbarItem.Identifier.fontStyle,\
NSToolbarItem.Identifier.fontSize,\
NSToolbarItem.Identifier.space,\
NSToolbarItem.Identifier.flexibleSpace,\
NSToolbarItem.Identifier.print ]
}

### Specify Default Toolbar Items

When the sample app launches for the first time, a default set of items appear in the toolbar. The sample provides these items by implementing the `toolbarDefaultItemIdentifiers(_:)` delegate method, which returns an array containing the font style and font size item identifiers.

return [.fontStyle, .fontSize]
}

### Create a Toolbar Item from an Identifier

The toolbar asks its delegate to create a toolbar item by calling the `toolbar(_:itemForItemIdentifier:willBeInsertedIntoToolbar:)` method. It calls this method when adding an item to the toolbar but also when adding items to the toolbar’s customization palette.

The sample app’s implementation of this method creates items for the two identifiers created in the app, font style and font size.

func toolbar(
_ toolbar: NSToolbar,
itemForItemIdentifier itemIdentifier: NSToolbarItem.Identifier,

var toolbarItem: NSToolbarItem?

/** Create a new NSToolbarItem instance and set its attributes based on
the provided item identifier.
*/

if itemIdentifier == NSToolbarItem.Identifier.fontStyle {
// 1) Font style toolbar item.
toolbarItem =
customToolbarItem(itemForItemIdentifier: NSToolbarItem.Identifier.fontStyle.rawValue,
label: NSLocalizedString("Font Style", comment: ""),
paletteLabel: NSLocalizedString("Font Style", comment: ""),
toolTip: NSLocalizedString("tool tip font style", comment: ""),
itemContent: styleSegmentView)!
} else if itemIdentifier == NSToolbarItem.Identifier.fontSize {
// 2) Font size toolbar item.
toolbarItem =
customToolbarItem(itemForItemIdentifier: NSToolbarItem.Identifier.fontSize.rawValue,
label: NSLocalizedString("Font Size", comment: ""),
paletteLabel: NSLocalizedString("Font Size", comment: ""),
toolTip: NSLocalizedString("tool tip font size", comment: ""),
itemContent: fontSizeView)!
}

return toolbarItem
}

The delegate isn’t responsible for creating toolbar items for standard identifiers; AppKit creates those toolbar items.

### Use a Custom View for a Toolbar Item

The font style and font size toolbar items display a custom view that the sample defines in `Main.storyboard` and connects with outlets in `WindowController`.

// Font style toolbar item.
@IBOutlet var styleSegmentView: NSView! // The font style changing view (ends up in an NSToolbarItem).

// Font size toolbar item.
@IBOutlet var fontSizeView: NSView! // The font size changing view (ends up in an NSToolbarItem).

When the toolbar calls the delegate method `toolbar(_:itemForItemIdentifier:willBeInsertedIntoToolbar:)`, the sample creates the toolbar item by calling its helper function `customToolbarItem`, passing in the custom view for the requested toolbar item.

func customToolbarItem(
itemForItemIdentifier itemIdentifier: String,
label: String,
paletteLabel: String,
toolTip: String,

let toolbarItem = NSToolbarItem(itemIdentifier: NSToolbarItem.Identifier(rawValue: itemIdentifier))

toolbarItem.label = label
toolbarItem.paletteLabel = paletteLabel
toolbarItem.toolTip = toolTip
toolbarItem.target = self

// Set the right attribute, depending on if we were given an image or a view.
if itemContent is NSImage {
if let image = itemContent as? NSImage {
toolbarItem.image = image
}
} else if itemContent is NSView {
if let view = itemContent as? NSView {
toolbarItem.view = view
}
} else {
assertionFailure("Invalid itemContent: object")
}

// We actually need an NSMenuItem here, so we construct one.
let menuItem: NSMenuItem = NSMenuItem()
menuItem.submenu = nil
menuItem.title = label
toolbarItem.menuFormRepresentation = menuItem

### Add More Attributes to a Toolbar Item

The sample’s toolbar delegate also implements the `toolbarWillAddItem(_:)` method to know when the toolbar is about to add an item. This gives the delegate the opportunity to add or change state information for the item. For example, the sample sets the `toolTip` property of a toolbar item with the `print` identifier.

func toolbarWillAddItem(_ notification: Notification) {
let userInfo = notification.userInfo!
if let addedItem = userInfo["item"] as? NSToolbarItem {
let itemIdentifier = addedItem.itemIdentifier
if itemIdentifier == .print {
addedItem.toolTip = NSLocalizedString("print string", comment: "")
addedItem.target = self
}
}
}

### Provide Toolbar Customization to Users

The sample app provides these behaviors by setting the toolbar’s `allowsUserCustomization` and `autosavesConfiguration` properties to `true`.

/*	If you pass false here, you turn off the customization palette. The
NSWindow method -runToolbarCustomizationPalette: handles the display
of the palette, which you can see in Interface Builder is connected
to the"Customize Toolbar" menu item.
*/
toolbar.allowsUserCustomization = true

/*	Tell the toolbar that it should save any toolbar configuration changes
to user defaults, that is, persist any mode changes or item reordering.
The app writes the configuration to the app domain using the toolbar
identifier as the key.
*/
toolbar.autosavesConfiguration = true

### Add Touch Bar Support

The sample app provides Touch Bar support that works in conjunction with the toolbar. Like the toolbar, the app provides two items on the Touch Bar: font style and font size.

Before the sample app can add items to the Touch Bar, it needs to create an `NSTouchBar` object. The sample does this by overriding the `makeTouchBar()` method, where it creates and returns a new Touch Bar object.

Then, similar to adding toolbar items, the sample implements the `NSTouchBarDelegate` method `touchBar(_:makeItemForIdentifier:)`, where it creates and returns Touch Bar items for the specified identifier.

let touchBar = NSTouchBar()
touchBar.delegate = self
touchBar.customizationIdentifier = .touchBar
touchBar.defaultItemIdentifiers = [.fontStyle, .popover, NSTouchBarItem.Identifier.otherItemsProxy]
touchBar.customizationAllowedItemIdentifiers = [.fontStyle, .popover]

return touchBar
}

# Creating and Customizing the Touch Bar

Adopt Touch Bar support by displaying interactive content and controls for your macOS apps.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

You can use the Touch Bar to display interactive content and controls for supported models of MacBook Pro.

This sample uses a split-view controller architecture to navigate various ways to implement the `NSTouchBar` class. The `PrimaryViewController` class shows the available use cases. When you select one of the use cases, the secondary view shows what you can do with the Touch Bar controls.

The description in each secondary view controller reflects its target item. For example, the `ButtonViewController` class shows how to use an `NSButton` object. The sample hosts all view controllers in separate storyboards.

Refer to this sample if you’re looking for specific ways to use and customize the `NSTouchBar`. It shows how to create an `NSTouchBarItem` for use with buttons, views, pickers, sliders, popovers, scrubbers, text fields, and text views.

The sample also displays a secondary window that shows a typical use case with the Touch Bar that uses an `NSScrubber` to pick an image that changes the window background.

### Configure the Sample Code Project

In Xcode, select your development team on the macOS target’s Signing and Capabilities tab.

### Create the Touch Bar

Create a Touch Bar by adding one to a view controller in the storyboard, or by creating one programmatically by overriding the `NSResponder` `makeTouchBar()` function. The following example demonstrates overriding `makeTouchBar()` for an `NSViewController` that displays a color-picker button or `NSColorPickerTouchBarItem`:

let touchBar = NSTouchBar()
touchBar.delegate = self

touchBar.customizationIdentifier = colorPickerBar
touchBar.defaultItemIdentifiers = [selectedItemIdentifier]
touchBar.customizationAllowedItemIdentifiers = [selectedItemIdentifier]
touchBar.principalItemIdentifier = selectedItemIdentifier

return touchBar
}

### Add Content to the Touch Bar

Add content to the Touch Bar by adopting the `NSTouchBarDelegate` protocol and implementing `touchBar(_:makeItemForIdentifier:)`. The following example adds a Sharing Service button:

guard identifier == services else { return nil }

let services = NSSharingServicePickerTouchBarItem(identifier: identifier)
services.delegate = self

return services
}

### Add a Scrubber to the Touch Bar

The `NSScrubber` class provides a way to add a flexible, horizontally oriented picker. Add a scrubber view to an `NSCustomTouchBarItem`, and that view adds a scrubber to the Touch Bar.

let scrubberItem: NSCustomTouchBarItem

scrubberItem = NSCustomTouchBarItem(identifier: identifier)
scrubberItem.customizationLabel = NSLocalizedString("Choose Photo", comment: "")

let scrubber = NSScrubber()
scrubber.register(NSScrubberImageItemView.self, forItemIdentifier: itemViewIdentifier)
scrubber.mode = .free
scrubber.selectionBackgroundStyle = .roundedBackground
scrubber.delegate = self
scrubber.dataSource = self
scrubber.showsAdditionalContentIndicators = true
scrubber.scrubberLayout = NSScrubberFlowLayout()

scrubberItem.view = scrubber

// Set the scrubber's width to be 400.
let viewBindings: [String: NSView] = ["scrubber": scrubber]
let hconstraints =
NSLayoutConstraint.constraints(withVisualFormat: "H:[scrubber(400)]",
options: [],
metrics: nil,
views: viewBindings)
NSLayoutConstraint.activate(hconstraints)

return scrubberItem
}

### Add a Popover to the Touch Bar

An `NSCustomTouchBarItem` class shows its own Touch Bar when the user taps and holds on it. This class is a two-state control that can expand into its second state, which shows the contents of a bar it owns. The second Touch Bar displays when this item _pops_. The following example shows how to create an `NSPopoverTouchBarItem` with an `NSScrubber` view with a set of numbered text items:

guard identifier == scrubberPopover else { return nil }

let popoverItem = NSPopoverTouchBarItem(identifier: identifier)
popoverItem.collapsedRepresentationLabel =
NSLocalizedString("Scrubber Popover", comment: "")
popoverItem.customizationLabel =
NSLocalizedString("Scrubber Popover", comment: "")

let scrubber = PopoverScrubber()
scrubber.register(NSScrubberTextItemView.self, forItemIdentifier: textScrubber)

scrubber.mode = .free
scrubber.selectionBackgroundStyle = .roundedBackground
scrubber.delegate = self
scrubber.dataSource = self
scrubber.presentingItem = popoverItem

popoverItem.collapsedRepresentation = scrubber

popoverItem.popoverTouchBar =
PopoverTouchBarSample(presentingItem: popoverItem)

return popoverItem
}

## Overview

On supported MacBook Pro models, the Touch Bar, above the keyboard, shows instances of the `NSTouchBar` class from the front-most app. Such an instance is called a _bar_. You define a bar to provide controls relevant to the user’s context. Each such control is an instance of the `NSTouchBarItem` class, called an _item_.

You can provide many bars within your app, one for each responder instance; macOS frameworks can provide bars, as well, that can appear alongside your app’s bars. The system determines which bars to show at any given time. For example, an app that uses standard AppKit objects, such as text fields (instances of the `NSTextField` class), obtains appropriate bars along with relevant items automatically.

Refer to the following sample code projects, which demonstrate how to use `NSTouchBar` and related classes, including the `NSScrubber` class, with its rich API that lets you build a highly customized picker control:

- Creating and Customizing the Touch Bar

- Integrating a Toolbar and Touch Bar into Your App

To use the Touch Bar, define bars in objects in your app’s responder chain. At run time, the system traverses up the responder chain to discover, combine, and show bars from your app and from frameworks you link against.

You can configure a bar to support dynamic composition, in which the system shows the bar in an expanded form that contains items from bars lower in the responder chain (from closer to the first responder). Because of dynamic composition and placement of items shown on the Touch Bar, always ensure that your bars appear as you expect them to, testing on the versions of macOS that you support.

Instances of the `NSTouchBar` class employ gesture recognizers and take advantage of macOS 10.12.1 event enhancements. Because of the physical geometry of the Touch Bar, touch events passed to gesture recognizers have only a meaningful _x_, or horizontal, component.

There’s no need, and no API, for your app to know whether or not there’s a Touch Bar available. Whether your app is running on a machine that supports the Touch Bar or not, your app’s onscreen user interface (UI) appears and behaves the same way.

The Touch Bar is a Retina display, like the screen of a MacBook Pro. To perform custom drawing or animation within the Touch Bar, follow the same best practices that you would on the screen.

On the right side of the Touch Bar, the system supplies the always-available _Control Strip_. The Control Strip gives the user access to standard controls for display brightness, sound volume, Siri, and so on. Your app’s bars appear to the left of the Control Strip. The user can choose to hide the Control Strip, which gives the frontmost app the entire Touch Bar width.

To the right of the Control Strip is a Touch ID sensor. To use Touch ID on supported MacBook Pro models, use methods from the Local Authentication framework.

The Touch Bar dims automatically and wakes when the user touches it. Don’t show alerts in the Touch Bar, and don’t use the Touch Bar for widgets.

For Touch Bar design guidance, read Human Interface Guidelines.

### Bar objects

You can think of an `NSTouchBar` object (or _bar_), with its array of `NSTouchBarItem` objects (or _items_), as analogous to a window toolbar with its toolbar items, or a menu with its menu items.

To provide a bar in your app, define it in an object that meets three requirements. The object that defines the bar must:

- Be a responder (an instance of an `NSResponder` subclass) that’s present within a responder chain at runtime.

- Implement the `makeTouchBar()` delegate method from the `NSTouchBarProvider` protocol.

The built-in responder classes conform to the `NSTouchBarProvider` protocol and support key-value observing (KVO), both of which are used and required by the `NSTouchBar` infrastructure. In the context of Touch Bar support, a responder instance can also be called a _bar provider_.

The following code shows an example implementation of the `makeTouchBar()` delegate method. In this code snippet, you can see some statements related to bar customization.

let mainBar = NSTouchBar()
mainBar.delegate = self mainBar.customizationIdentifier = .imageViewer
mainBar.defaultItemIdentifiers = [.sharingPicker, .strokePopover, .strokeColorPicker, .photoPicker, .flexibleSpace, .clearButton, .otherItemsProxy]
mainBar.customizationAllowedItemIdentifiers = [.strokeSlider, .strokePopover, .photoPicker, .strokeColorPicker, .clearButton, .sharingPicker, .flexibleSpace]
mainBar.principalItemIdentifier = .photoPicker
return mainBar
}

You can take advantage of built-in KVO support to keep track of bar state, such as which items are visible as the user customizes and interacts with the Touch Bar.

If you explicitly adopt the `NSTouchBarProvider` protocol in the app delegate or in a window delegate, you must also explicitly send the associated key-value observing notifications from within your implementations of `NSTouchBar` methods; this lets the system respond appropriately to changes in the bar. To avoid the need to manually support KVO, use the _app object_ as a bar provider, instead of the app delegate, or use a _window controller_ or _window_ as a bar provider, instead of the associated window delegate.

To programmatically invalidate a bar associated with a bar provider, such as because you’re changing the bar’s state, set its `touchBar` property to a value of `nil`.

### Item objects

A bar itself (an `NSTouchBar` object) has no visible representation in a MacBook Pro Touch Bar. A user instead sees the bar’s items, each of which is an instance of the `NSTouchBarItem` class.

The items presented in a bar are the elements in a private array owned by the bar. To specify the items for a bar, you don’t fill this array directly, but rather rely on the bar to manage its items based on various groups of items and item identifiers that you do specify directly.

In specifying items for a bar you have two options, giving you flexibility for optimizing resource use and efficiency in your app.

- The `templateItems` property is a set that you can directly populate with item instances for a bar. Use this option when your items are lightweight enough to stay in memory for the duration of your app’s lifetime, and when they don’t contain state that might change over time.

- The `NSTouchBarDelegate` protocol, and its `touchBar(_:makeItemForIdentifier:)` delegate method, give your app a way to create items on-demand. Use this option when it makes more sense in terms of resource usage and reflecting dynamic state.

Whichever of these two approaches you employ, the system is in charge of populating a bar’s private items array based on three things:

1. Your configuration of the bar’s item-identifiers properties

2. Any nesting you have specified

3. Any customization that the user has specified for the bar

As your app runs, you can obtain the identifiers of the items eligible for presentation in a bar — specifically, those in its private items array — by accessing the read-only `itemIdentifiers` property. This property reflects the current state of the bar instance, including any customization that has been performed by the user and any dynamic composition that has been performed by the system.

### Customization

AppKit provides a rich Touch Bar customization facility for users that appears, upon user request, on the main display. Make your bars customizable unless you have a specific UI need not to do so.

A customizable bar automatically obtains onscreen UI which lets the user:

- Change which items are part of the shown bar

- Rearrange items within the shown bar

A user invokes the onscreen customization UI by choosing a dedicated menu item.

To make an `NSTouchBar` object eligible for customization, assign it a globally-unique `customizationIdentifier` identifier. For the identifier string, use reverse-DNS style, such as “ `com.company-name.app-name.alphanumeric-ID`”.

Next, specify the bar’s items and customization possibilities by populating its item identifier lists. Each such list is an array, each of whose elements is the identifier (of type `NSTouchBarItem.Identifier`) for an item (an `NSTouchBarItem` object). A bar’s item identifier lists are:

**Default item identifiers**, specified in a bar’s `defaultItemIdentifiers` property. Always specify this property for an `NSTouchBar` object, even if you elect to make the bar noncustomizable. The system:

- Shows this list’s items by default when the system displays the bar.

- Includes a preconfigured bar representation, containing these items, in the associated customization UI (when you have designated the bar as customizable by assigning it a `customizationIdentifier` property value); the user can drag the default bar into the Touch Bar, should they want to property. Always configure this property for a customizable bar. The system uses this list by showing representations of its items individually in the customization UI, arranged in the same order as you specify in the property array. When there’s available geometric space, a user can drag in to the active bar any of the items in this list. If there isn’t enough space, a dragged item replaces the item or items under the spot the new item is dropped.

**Required item identifiers**, specified in a bar’s `customizationRequiredItemIdentifiers` property. Configure this property at your discretion, depending on the design of your app. The user can’t remove from the bar any of the items you specify in this list.

To provide textual labels in the customization UI, use the `customizationLabel` property on each `NSTouchBarItem` instance you include in a customizable bar. The accessibility system in macOS also makes use of these labels.

If your app design requires a noncustomizable `NSTouchBar` object:

- List all of the bar’s items in the `defaultItemIdentifiers` property, and only in this property.

- Don’t use the other properties described in this section and, in particular, don’t assign the bar a `customizationIdentifier` property value.

#### Group item, popover item, and composed bar customization

AppKit lets you specify any bar as customizable or not. The customization configuration you provide for a bar remains associated with the bar and its items — even when those items are nested by the system into another bar higher in the responder chain.

The system also respects your bar customization configuration when you use group and popover items. Each of these item types itself contains one or more bars—which can, in turn contain group items and popover items, and so on. The rest of this section explains how customization works for the bars containing, and bars within, group items and popover items.

**A group item** (an instance of the `NSGroupTouchBarItem` class) has one bar, held in the object’s `groupTouchBar` property. AppKit supports nesting of group items, in that you can configure a `groupTouchBar` bar to itself contain one or more group items (or, for that matter, items of any other type, guided by what works well in your app).Here are some examples of how customization for group items works in practice:

- If you configure a bar as customizable, and give it a group item whose bar you configure as _not_ customizable, then the array of items in the `groupTouchBar` bar appears in the customization UI as an atomic unit. During customization, a user can manipulate the array of items, but strictly as a unit: If the (noncustomizable) `groupTouchBar` bar is visible in the Touch Bar, the user can remove it as a unit, or can rearrange it among the other items in the `groupTouchBar` bar; if the `groupTouchBar` bar is instead visible in the customization UI, the user can add it bar’s items appear in the customization UI as individual items. During customization, a user can manipulate each item separately: If an item from the `groupTouchBar` bar is visible in the Touch Bar, the user can remove it or can rearrange its position individually among the other items in the `groupTouchBar` bar; if an item from the `groupTouchBar` bar is instead visible in the customization UI, the user can add it bar that owns it.

**A popover item** (an instance of the `NSPopoverTouchBarItem` class) has two bars: one bar you specify in its `popoverTouchBar` property and a second, optional bar you can specify in its `pressAndHoldTouchBar` property. Here are some examples of how customization for popover items works in practice:

- If you configure a bar as customizable, and give it a popover item whose `popoverTouchBar` bar you configure as _not_ customizable, the `popoverTouchBar` bar never appears in the customization UI. If the user invokes the customization UI when the (noncustomizable) popover item itself (not the button’s associated `popoverTouchBar` bar) is visible in the Touch Bar, the customization UI lets the user rearrange the position of the popover item relative to the other items in the containing bar. If, on the other hand, the user invokes the customization UI when the (noncustomizable) `popoverTouchBar` bar is visible in the Touch Bar, the system dismisses the popover bar and shows, in the customization UI, customization options for the bar that contains the popover item.

- If you configure a `popoverTouchBar` bar as customizable, the user can invoke the `popoverTouchBar` bar (by tapping the popover item that owns it, in the Touch Bar) and then use the customization UI to manipulate the items in the `popoverTouchBar` bar itself.

#### Customization menu item

A user invokes the customization UI for a particular `NSTouchBar` object, when it’s visible in the Touch Bar, by choosing the bar customization menu item. To enable this menu item you must explicitly opt-in, which you can do in the following ways:

- If you want the system to automatically name, place, validate, and activate this menu item in your app’s menus, set the `isAutomaticCustomizeTouchBarMenuItemEnabled` property of your app object (of type `NSApplication`) to `true`.

- To explicitly place the customization menu item in one of your app’s menus, employ the `toggleTouchBarCustomizationPalette(_:)` method of your app object. When you do this, the system still names and validates the menu item, and hides it on systems that don’t have a Touch Bar.

If you attempt to employ the customization menu item (using either of these two approaches), but do not provide a customization identifier property ( `customizationIdentifier`) for a bar, the customization menu item appears when that bar is active — but the menu item, in this case, is disabled.

If your app attempts to use both automatic and explicit placement of the customization menu item, the system respects your explicit control and doesn’t place the item automatically.

### Layout

The user controls the width of the Control Strip and can choose to hide it, and the system is in charge of the nesting of `NSTouchBar` instances (for the bars you make eligible for composition). As a result, the available display width for your bars can vary. There’s no API for you to obtain the current available display width.

In your layout design, don’t depend on a particular Control Strip size. Do anticipate dynamic composition and nesting for your bars.

If you need more horizontal space than might be available, use a popover item, a scrubber, or a scroll view — as they fit your design needs, but in that, descending, order of preference.

In geometric-space-constrained scenarios, the system hides `NSTouchBarItem` instances according to their visibility priority.

If you need to center an item in the Touch Bar, designate it as a _principal item_ by assigning it to its bar’s `principalItemIdentifier` property. Don’t hard-code spacing in an attempt to ensure an item is centered. If you want a group of items to appear centered in the Touch Bar, designate the group item (of type `NSGroupTouchBarItem`) as the principal item.

### Composition and nesting

You can configure a bar to support dynamic composition, in which the system shows the bar in an expanded form that contains items from bars lower in the responder chain (closer to the first responder).

To allow a bar to serve as a container for nesting, add the `otherItemsProxy` item identifier to the bar’s `defaultItemIdentifiers` array. A bar that includes this identifier, and that’s relatively higher in the responder chain, can then (at runtime) include the items from an eligible bar relatively lower in the responder chain.

The position that you specify for the other-items proxy, within a bar’s `defaultItemIdentifiers` array, tells the system where you want nested items to be placed.

The system determines whether or not to compose bars in this way, based on system policy and available geometric space in the Touch Bar.

`NSTouchBar` object nesting can be chained, according to available geometric space in the Touch Bar. For example, a view and a text field within that view could each contribute their items to the bar defined for a parent window controller.

When the system nests one bar’s items into another bar higher in the responder chain, the items appear to the user, in the Touch Bar, as fully incorporated into the higher bar. There’s no visual boundary or additional spacing to distinguish the items as being nested.

If a bar doesn’t employ the `otherItemsProxy` identifier, the system hides that bar when another bar, lower in the responder chain, is eligible for display.

When determining which items to show in the Touch Bar for the current first responder, the system traverses up the entire responder chain. This lets the system accommodate any proxy items in bars defined for objects higher in the chain, thereby respecting the fact that any bar, defined for an object at any position in the responder chain, might include the other-items-proxy identifier.

#### Customization for composed bars

The logical, geometric boundary for a nested `NSTouchBar` object isn’t visible to the user in the Touch Bar. However, the boundary remains in effect in terms of customization. A user can’t rearrange a nested bar’s items outside of its boundary.

For example, say you have a bar, higher in the responder chain, configured like this:

[(1)(2)(other-items-proxy)(3)]

And say you also have a bar, lower in the responder chain, eligible for display in the Touch Bar according to the system and the current app state, configured like this:

[(A)(B)(C)]

The composed bar would correspond to this arrangement in the Touch Bar:

[(1)(2)(A)(B)(C)(3)]

With the customization UI, the user could then rearrange the items represented here by `(A)`, `(B)`, and `(C)`, but only as long as those items remained contiguous during the rearrangement, thereby respecting the logical boundary of the bar that defines them.

#### Item spacing for composed bars

When the system nests `NSTouchBar` objects that include spacing items, it merges any resulting adjacent spacing. Ensure that your bars appear as you expect them to, testing on the versions of macOS that you support. For more on spacing items, see `NSTouchBarItem`.

### Bar discovery and the responder chain

At runtime, the system traverses up the responder chain, starting at the object with focus, to discover objects that conform to the `NSTouchBarProvider` protocol. Such objects are called _bar providers_. The system then populates the Touch Bar, potentially with multiple, nested bars, according to system policy and available geometric space.

Specifically, bar discovery by the system proceeds in the following order:

01. Key window’s first responder

02. Key window

03. Key window’s delegate

04. Key window’s controller

05. Main window’s first responder

06. Main window

07. Main window’s delegate

08. Main window’s controller

09. App object

10. App delegate

When the system encounters a bar provider that’s an instance of an `NSResponder` subclass, the system then additionally searches up the responder chain anchored at that object.

For example, in a complicated but otherwise standard app, bar discovery might proceed in this order:

1. Key window’s first responder

2. View controller of key window’s first responder

3. Intermediate view controllers and views

4. View that’s closest to root of window

5. View controller that’s closest to root of window

6. Key window

7. Key window’s controller

8. App object

9. App delegate

The Touch Bar can show one bar nested within another, as described in Composition and nesting.

### Accessibility and the Touch Bar

AppKit views and controls adopt the `NSAccessibilityProtocol` protocol and automatically send appropriate accessibility notifications. Because the Touch Bar is designed to work with AppKit, it’s fully accessible.

Be sure to use the `customizationLabel` property on every `NSTouchBarItem` instance that you designate as customizable. The accessibility system in macOS makes use of these labels.

To learn more about accessibility, read Accessibility for AppKit.

### AppKit support for the Touch Bar

To support the Touch Bar feature, AppKit provides several enhancements, first available in macOS 10.12.1:

- **Scrubbers.** The `NSScrubber` class, along with related APIs, provide a way for you to add a flexible, horizontally-oriented picker to a custom item (an instance of the `NSCustomTouchBarItem` class).

- **Gesture recognizer support.**

- You can use the `NSMagnificationGestureRecognizer` class in bar items. To enable two-finger pinch gestures, set the recognizer’s `allowedTouchTypes` mask property, on the gesture recognizer, to the `NSTouch.TouchType.direct` constant from the `NSTouch.TouchTypeMask` enumeration.

- The `NSGestureRecognizer` abstract class is enhanced with a set of methods that let you implement responses to touch events: `touchesBegan(with:)`, `touchesCancelled(with:)`, `touchesEnded(with:)`, and `touchesMoved(with:)`.

- The `NSClickGestureRecognizer`, `NSPanGestureRecognizer`, and `NSPressGestureRecognizer` concrete classes are each enhanced with a `numberOfTouchesRequired` property to let you specify the number of touches required for a gesture match.

- **Touch type changes.** To enable touch events in a custom view, you must set the value of a view’s `allowedTouchTypes` property to a value of `direct`. (In macOS 10.12.1, the `acceptsTouchEvents` property is deprecated in favor of the new `allowedTouchTypes` property.)

- **Touch changes.** The `NSTouch` class has a new property and two new methods for supporting the Touch Bar: `NSTouch.TouchType`, `location(in:)`, and `previousLocation(in:)`.

- **Control appearance support.** The `NSButton`, `NSSegmentedControl`, and `NSSlider` classes are each enhanced with appearance support properties: `bezelColor` for buttons, `selectedSegmentBezelColor` for segmented controls, and `trackFillColor` for sliders. (With the Touch Bar, you employ sliders indirectly, as used by slider items.)

- **Convenience initializers.** Starting in macOS 10.12, you can use a rich set of convenience initializers for controls. These initializers simplify the definition of bar items and take care of appearance and sizing for the Touch Bar. In particular, the `NSButton`, `NSSegmentedControl`, and `NSSlider` classes now offer a variety of convenience initializers such as `init(title:image:target:action:)`.

- **Text support.** Methods and properties in the `NSSpellChecker`, `NSTextField`, and `NSTextView` classes, and in the `NSTextFieldDelegate` and `NSTextViewDelegate` protocols, support using the Touch Bar for spell checking, predictive text suggestion, text completion, and automatic handling of trailing space. For example:

- When you use an `NSTextView` object, you gain automatic Touch Bar support for text styling and predictive text suggestions.

- When you use an `NSCandidateListTouchBarItem` object, you can use the `requestCandidates(forSelectedRange:in:types:options:inSpellDocumentWithTag:completionHandler:)` method. This method provides a completion handler that you can use to filter or otherwise manage the candidate text.

- **New template images.** AppKit adds many new template images for you to use in your `NSTouchBarItem` objects. A few examples of these images are: `touchBarAddTemplateName`, `touchBarComposeTemplateName`, `touchBarGoBackTemplateName`, `touchBarGoForwardTemplateName`, and `NSImageNameTouchBarHomeTemplate`. Always use templates for images in your items: they respond automatically to system white-point changes. Note that these images are exclusively for use in the Touch Bar and _not_ in onscreen windows. For a complete list of these template images, see `NSTouchBarItem`.

- **Scroll views.** If your UI for a popover item needs more horizontal space, you can use a scroll view (an instance of the `NSScrollView` class). _Don’t_, in this case, enable the popover item’s press-and-hold option, because doing so interferes with scrolling.

- **Stack views.** You can group bar items by using an instance of the `NSStackView` class. However, doing so loses system support for spacing. When you instead place items into a group item (an instance of the `NSGroupTouchBarItem` class), the system:

- Manages inter-item spacing

- Supports user customization for the individual items

### Development considerations for the Touch Bar

The Xcode Touch Bar simulator represents the Touch Bar onscreen and supports some user interaction. However, some interactions are unavailable in the simulator. For example, you can’t perform two-finger gestures in the Touch Bar simulator.

Interface Builder supports development for the Touch Bar with nib objects available in the object library. Drag and drop bars and items from the object library into your canvas, and then attach them to your app’s responders as desired. For more information, see Xcode Help.

### Performance considerations for the Touch Bar

The Touch Bar’s display and the MacBook screen share resources, including the main CPU and GPU of the MacBook. To ensure that your Touch Bar controls perform well, follow the usual best practice of protecting your app’s main thread from doing too much work. For example, don’t perform rendering work for the main display on the main thread.

In addition, pay attention to the relative amounts of time your app spends on updates to the main display relative to updates to the Touch Bar. The optimum ratio can vary according to what the user is doing. For example:

- When a user is interacting with the Touch Bar _and_ watching the Touch Bar, such as to control audio, ensure that your app gives priority to updating the Touch Bar.

- When a user is instead interacting with the Touch Bar but watching the main display, such as when using a scrubber to browse pages of content, balance your app’s display update work between the Touch Bar and the main display.

Always test Touch Bar performance using the specific MacBook hardware you support. Specifically, don’t rely on the Xcode Touch Bar simulator when tuning your app for Touch Bar performance.

class NSTouchBarItem

## Overview

An instance of the `NSTouchBarItem` class is called an _item_. It appears to the user on the Touch Bar, typically along with other items, within the (invisible) bounds of the view for an `NSTouchBar` object, called a _bar_.

You use an item by adding it or its identifier to one or another of a bar’s arrays, depending on your app’s architecture and on the user customization you want to support. Because of the close interaction between bars and items, be sure you have read the overview for the `NSTouchBar` class before continuing here to learn about items.

AppKit provides a rich set of subclasses of `NSTouchBarItem`, each of which is described in the corresponding class reference document:

- An `NSCandidateListTouchBarItem` object (a _candidate-list item_), along with its delegate, provides a list of textual suggestions for the current text view

- An `NSColorPickerTouchBarItem` object (a _color picker item_) provides a system-defined color picker

- An `NSCustomTouchBarItem` object (a _custom item_) contains a responder of your choice, such as a view, a button, or a scrubber (an instance of the `NSScrubber` class)

- An `NSGroupTouchBarItem` object (a _group item_) provides a bar to contain other items

- An `NSPopoverTouchBarItem` object (a _popover item_) provides a two-state control that, when touched or pressed, expands into its second state, showing the contents of a bar it owns

- An `NSSharingServicePickerTouchBarItem` object (a _sharing service picker item_), along with its delegate, provides a list of objects eligible for sharing

- An `NSSliderTouchBarItem` object (a _slider item_) provides a slider control for choosing a value in a range

The two most commonly-used item classes are `NSCustomTouchBarItem` and `NSPopoverTouchBarItem`.

Refer to the following sample code projects which demonstrate how to use `NSTouchBarItem` and related classes:

- Creating and Customizing the Touch Bar

- Integrating a Toolbar and Touch Bar into Your App

### Custom items

You typically use a _custom item_ (an instance of the `NSCustomTouchBarItem` class) to hold a view. For example, to place a button in the Touch Bar, proceed as follows:

1. Use an `NSButton` convenience initializer such as `init(title:image:target:action:)` to create and configure the button.

2. Set the `view` property for a custom item to point to the new button.

### Popover items

A _popover item_ (an instance of the `NSPopoverTouchBarItem` class) — the second commonly-used type — lets you provide a new bar (an `NSTouchBar` object) when a user taps, or presses-and-holds, on the collapsed representation of the popover item.

In its expanded state, a popover appears as an overlay above other items in the Touch Bar.

To show a bar when a user taps a popover item, specify a bar in the item’s `popoverTouchBar` property. Enable press-and-hold by specifying a bar in the `pressAndHoldTouchBar` property. The press-and-hold feature is suitable only for a simple popover, such as one that contains a single segmented control (an instance of the `NSSegmentedControl` class) or slider (an instance of the `NSSliderTouchBarItem` class).

The system automatically shows a chevron in the popover item under the following conditions: You specify the same `NSTouchBar` object for both `pressAndHoldTouchBar` and `popoverTouchBar` properties, _and_ you use the default view for the popover item’s `collapsedRepresentation` property.

If you provide a popover item that contains a scrubber (an `NSScrubber` instance), you’ll likely want to dismiss both the scrubber and the popover after the user makes their selection in the scrubber. A good approach to achieve this user interaction is to subclass `NSPopoverTouchBarItem`, employing your instance of the subclass as the scrubber’s delegate. You can then configure the delegate object, within its `didFinishInteracting(with:)` method, to call the popover’s `dismissPopover(_:)` method.

If you place a segmented control in a bar for a popover item, take care _not_ to use `NSSegmentedControl.SwitchTracking.momentary` option of the `NSSegmentedControl.SwitchTracking` enumeration because doing so interferes with the user’s operation of the control.

### Other common item types

To provide a _slider item_, always use the `NSSliderTouchBarItem` class, which employs a standard slider but is optimized for user interaction with the Touch Bar. (That is, don’t instead add an `NSSlider` object directly to a custom item.)

A _group item_ (an instance of the `NSGroupTouchBarItem` class) is a container that provides a bar, in its `groupTouchBar` property, with its own array of items. You can enable customization for the items in a group’s contained bar, in the same way you would for items directly within a top-level bar. Using a group item lets you provide different user customization rules for different parts of the Touch Bar. Using a group item also lets you enable centering of the group within the Touch Bar.

A _spacing item_ lets you add custom spacing between items in a bar. Specify a spacing item for a bar by assigning the `fixedSpaceSmall`, `fixedSpaceLarge`, or `flexibleSpace` identifier to an item, and adding that item to the bar’s items array. The system automatically instantiates and configures spacing items based on the identifiers you specify.

### Configuration

You must configure each item with a unique identifier, and can optionally assign a visibility priority or tag it as a principal item.

**NSTouchBarItem identification.** You must provide a unique identifier for each item in the bar, apart from spacing items. Specify an identifier, of type `NSTouchBarItem.Identifier` (called an _item identifier_), for each item when you initialize it. The item identifier serves as a persistable weak reference to the item. The system uses item identifiers to populate bars and to track and record changes for user customization.

**NSTouchBarItem priority for visibility.** If the system is showing a bar in the Touch Bar, but horizontal space is constrained and the bar defines more items than will fit, the system hides some of the items. You influence this hide/show behavior by setting a value for the `visibilityPriority` property of each item.

Lower-visibility-priority items get hidden by the system, as needed, before higher-visibility-priority items do.

To set visibility priority, use the constants in the `NSTouchBarItem.Priority` enumeration, or assign an integer value. The value `0` indicates `normal` visibility priority. Visibility priority increases with increasing numerical value. The `low` constant provides a value of `-1000`; the `high` constant, a value `+1000`. You can use integers outside of this range if you need to.

The system hides or shows groups of identical-priority items (defined within a single bar) together. The one exception to this rule is for items whose visibility priority is `normal`; these items get hidden one-by-one, with the normal-priority item farthest to the right getting hidden first. If horizontal space later increases in the Touch Bar, and hidden, normal-priority items become eligible for display, the system first shows the most recently-hidden of those items.

**Principal Items.** Within a bar, you can optionally specify an item as having special significance by employing the `principalItemIdentifier` property. The system attempts to center a principal item within the Touch Bar. If you want a group of items to appear centered in the Touch Bar, designate the group item (of type `NSTouchBarItem`) as the principal item.

If more than one bar in the responder chain is eligible to be visible in the Touch Bar, and more than one of those has a principal item, the system determines which one to center in the Touch Bar.

#### Fonts, images, and colors

When using a button in a custom item, don’t attempt to set the button title’s font. In the Touch Bar, the system specifies fonts for standard controls.

If you need to specify a font, such as for custom drawing, use the `systemFont(ofSize:)` class method (or related methods) of the `NSFont` class. Use a font size of `0` to automatically obtain appropriate sizing for the Touch Bar.

If you use an image in a button or other control in the Touch Bar, take care to employ a template image. Template images in the Touch Bar respond automatically to system white-point changes, and automatically react to user interactions. The overview in this document lists the built-in Touch Bar template images.

To use your own image assets, use Retina-resolution images, designated as `@2x` in your asset catalog and with a maximum height of 30 points (corresponding to 60 pixels).

To set colors on objects within an `NSTouchBarItem` object, use AppKit named colors and use a bezel color property (available starting in macOS 10.12.1). Named colors appear correctly in the Touch Bar, support appearance vibrancy, and respond to system white-point changes. In a button or a segmented control, employ the bezel color property to ensure appropriate appearance in the Touch Bar.

To set the background color on a button within a custom item, use code like this:

myButton.bezelColor = NSColor.controlColor

To set color on text and glyphs in the Touch Bar, use the following colors from the `NSColor` class:

- `labelColor`

- `secondaryLabelColor`

- `tertiaryLabelColor`

- `quaternaryLabelColor`

The system automatically changes the relative brightness and the white-point of these colors, depending on the ambient light, and depending on other factors such as keyboard backlight level. Always use these colors, or colors that dynamically derive from these colors, for control backgrounds, text, icons, and glyphs in the Touch Bar.

#### Handling touch events

The easiest way to handle touch events in an item is to use AppKit controls, such as by adding a button, a segmented control, or a scrubber to the item. Standard AppKit controls convey touch events to your specified targets automatically, so use standard controls whenever possible in your app.

If standard controls are insufficient, you can create composite views with a combination of standard controls, custom views, and gesture recognizers that you manually add to those custom views.

If you require the lowest-level of control for touch event processing, you can use the `NSTouch` class directly. You might go this route, for example, to provide good user feedback in the case of a control placed within a scroll view.Direct use of touch methods allows fine-grained control over interaction. You can, for example, highlight a control immediately upon a user touching it, and then remove the highlight if the user then, without lifting the finger, performs a scroll gesture.

If using the `NSTouch` class directly, be sure to implement the `touchesCancelled(with:)` responder method, because users can perform touch interactions that result in canceled touches.

# NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

An object that specifies how user interface elements resize themselves when space is constrained.

class NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

## Overview

An instance of `NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions` contains zero or more options. Because a compression options object behaves like a set, you can use common operations like intersection, union and subtraction to interact with instances and their members.

You can access system-defined options through the class methods detailed in Creating standard options, or you can create your own custom options with the `init(identifier:)` initializer.

To compare two different compression options objects, use the methods described in the Comparing compression options section.

## Topics

### Creating a compression option

`init()`

Creates an option object containing no options.

Creates an option object that represents the union of the supplied options.

`init(identifier: String)`

Creates an option object with the given identifier string.

`init(coder: NSCoder)`

Creates an option object from data in an unarchiver.

### Creating standard options

`class var hideImages: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions`

An option specifying that views should hide their images.

`class var hideText: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions`

An option specifying that views should hide their text.

`class var reduceMetrics: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions`

An option specifying that views should reduce their internal metrics.

`class var breakEqualWidths: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions`

An option specifying that views should no longer maintain equal width constraints.

`class var standardOptions: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions`

An option that represents the union of all standard compression options.

### Comparing compression options

`var isEmpty: Bool`

A Boolean value that denotes whether the option is empty.

Determines whether the supplied compression options are all present in the current instance.

Determines whether the supplied compression options intersect with the current instance’s options.

### Combining compression options

Creates a new compression options object representing the union with the provided options.

Creates a new compression options object with the supplied options removed.

# NSScrubber

A customizable item picker control for the Touch Bar.

@MainActor
class NSScrubber

## Overview

On supported MacBook Pro models, you can use a scrubber (an instance of the `NSScrubber` class) to provide a horizontally-oriented, item-picker control in the Touch Bar. Use a scrubber to let the user pick an item from a related collection, such as a photo from a library or a date from a date range.

Refer to the following sample code projects which demonstrate how to use `NSTouchBar` and related classes, including the `NSScrubber` class:

- Creating and Customizing the Touch Bar

- Integrating a Toolbar and Touch Bar into Your App

Each item that appears in a scrubber is a specialized view that supports selection and scrubber-appropriate decorations. The scrubber keeps track of its items by their index positions.

There are many classes in the scrubber API, as well as a delegate protocol, a data source protocol, and a callback-based layout API. The design pattern is reminiscent of that used for a collection view (an instance of the `NSCollectionView` class). You might find it helpful to refer to the `NSCollectionView` overview for background. Be aware, though of the differences. For example, while scrubbers and collection views both employ a `makeItem(withIdentifier:owner:)` method, and both employ a reuse queue, a scrubber is subclassed from the `NSView` class while a collection view is subclassed from the `NSViewController` class.

A scrubber employs:

- The _scrubber object_ itself (an instance of the `NSScrubber` class), which serves as a container view that shows a subview for each scrubber item, and which employs a reuse-queue pattern for efficiency and performance.

- A _data source_ (conforming to the `NSScrubberDataSource` protocol), which provides scrubber items to the scrubber, on demand, from an associated data collection in your app. Specify the data source in the scrubber’s `dataSource` property

- A _delegate_ (conforming to the `NSScrubberDelegate` protocol), which responds to user interaction — such as with its `didBeginInteracting(with:)` and `didCancelInteracting(with:)` methods. Specify the delegate in the scrubber’s `delegate` property. You can also use the delegate to respond to the highlighting and selection of scrubber items, and to respond to changes in which items are visible in the scrubber.

- A _layout_ (an instance of a subclass of the `NSScrubberLayout` abstract class, typically the `NSScrubberFlowLayout` concrete subclass). You implement a layout to respond to calls, from the system, to return view specifications for the items to be displayed in the scrubber. The layout, in this way, assists in arranging and decorating the scrubber’s contained items, and in providing appearance changes in response to user interaction. Specify the layout in the scrubber’s `scrubberLayout` property.

Before learning how to use a scrubber in the Touch Bar, be sure you read the overview for the `NSTouchBar` class.

### Scrubber data source and delegate

A scrubber employs a data source and a delegate, using a pattern similar to that used for collection views, as follows:

**Data source.** To supply items for a scrubber, implement an object that conforms to the `NSScrubberDataSource` protocol and specify that object in the scrubber’s `dataSource` property. There are two built-in item types, provided by the `NSScrubberTextItemView` and `NSScrubberImageItemView` concrete classes. For more on scrubber items, see Scrubber items.

The following code shows an example implementation of the `numberOfItems` datasource method, returning the count of items displayed by the scrubber.

return self.scrubberItems.count;
}

- (NSInteger)numberOfItemsForScrubber:(NSScrubber *)theScrubber {
return self.scrubberItems.count;
}

In addition to the count of scrubber items, you use the datasource method to provide individual items with the `scrubber(_:viewForItemAt:)` method. An example implementation is shown in the following code.

itemView.title = String(index)
return itemView
}

- (NSScrubberItemView *)scrubber:(NSScrubber *)theScrubber viewForItemAtIndex:(NSInteger)index {
NSScrubberTextItemView *itemView = [scrubber makeItemWithIdentifier:textScrubberItemIdentifier owner:self];
if (index < 10) {
itemView.title = [@(index) stringValue];
}
return itemView;
}

To optimize resource usage and performance, a scrubber employs a reuse queue that’s similar to the reuse queue for an `NSCollectionView` object.

**Delegate.** To respond to user interactions and to visibility, highlighting, and selection changes, implement a delegate object that conforms to the `NSScrubberDelegate` protocol and specify that object in the scrubber’s `delegate` property.

The following code shows a minimal implementation of the `scrubber(_:didSelectItemAt:)` delegate method for a scrubber.

func scrubber(_ scrubber: NSScrubber, didSelectItemAt index: Int) {
// Log the index value for the item the user selected
print("\(#function) at index \(index)")
}

- (void)scrubber:(NSScrubber *)scrubber didSelectItemAtIndex:(NSInteger)selectedIndex {
// Log the index value for the item the user selected NSLog(@"selectedIndex = %ld", selectedIndex);
}

### Choose a scrubber touch-interaction model

A scrubber offers many built-in permutations for touch interaction. By subclassing a scrubber, you can customize touch interaction.

To specify a scrubber’s touch-interaction model, set values for the following, cooperating scrubber properties: `mode`, `isContinuous`, and `itemAlignment`. Here’s how to choose the right permutation of values for these properties:

**Scrolling or fixed.** Decide whether you want the scrubber to _scroll_ to track horizontal finger movement across the scrubber, or to remain _fixed_ in place as the finger moves.

- For scrolling, specify the `NSScrubber.Mode.free` value for the scrubber’s `mode` property.

- For a fixed scrubber, specify the `NSScrubber.Mode.fixed` value for the `mode` property (this is the default value). In this case, if the user’s finger reaches the left or right edge of the scrubber view and there are items beyond the edge, the scrubber automatically scrolls to bring those items into view.

**Selection style.** Decide whether you want item selection to take place only upon a deliberate selection gesture, or continuously during horizontal finger movement on the scrubber.

- For deliberate selection, specify a value of `false` for the scrubber’s `isContinuous` property (this is the default value). In _free_ (scrolling) mode, the user must then tap an item to highlight and select it. In _fixed_ (non-scrolling) mode, ending interaction with the scrubber, by lifting the finger, selects the most-recently highlighted item. However, if there is already a highlighted item before interaction starts, and the user resumes interacting with the (fixed mode) scrubber on that item, selection changes continuously, tracking the user’s finger — even though the `isContinuous` property value is `false`.

- For continuous selection, specify a value of `true` for the `isContinuous` property. Item selection behavior then depends on the `mode` and `itemAlignment` property values, as described in Position-based scrubber item selection.

**Item alignment.** The setting in the scrubber’s `itemAlignment` property affects two things: 1) item highlighting and selection, and 2) the resting position of scrubber items after manual or automatic scrolling. Available values for this property are `NSScrubber.Alignment.leading`, `NSScrubber.Alignment.center`, `NSScrubber.Alignment.trailing`, and `NSScrubber.Alignment.none`. See the `NSScrubber.Alignment` enumeration for details on how these constants work.

Your choices for scrolling, selection, and alignment jointly impact highlighting and selection behavior. For details on highlighting and selection, see Position-based scrubber item selection. Your choice for alignment also impacts scrubber-item resting-position behavior following a scroll interaction. For details on resting position, see Scrubber item resting position.

### Position-based scrubber item selection

In free mode with continuous selection style (the `mode` property value is `NSScrubber.Mode.free` and the `isContinuous` property value is `YES` for this configuration), the scrubber item on the alignment axis is automatically highlighted and selected. The _alignment axis_ is the left edge, right edge, or center of the scrubber, as you specify by setting the value of the `itemAlignment` property using constants from the `NSScrubber.Alignment` enumeration. Specifying an alignment axis of `NSScrubber.Alignment.none` is equivalent to a value of `NSScrubber.Alignment.center` for position-based item selection.

In free mode with deliberate selection style (the `mode` property value is `NSScrubber.Mode.free` and the `isContinuous` property value is `NO` for this configuration), the system ignores the `itemAlignment` property value in terms of item selection.

In fixed mode (the `mode` property value is `NSScrubber.Mode.fixed` for this configuration), the system ignores the `itemAlignment` property value in terms of item selection — no matter which value you specify for the `isContinuous` property.

### Scrubber item resting position

The value you provide in the `itemAlignment` property specifies the automatic scrubber item resting position that follows manual or automatic scrolling. (This value also affects item highlighting and selection, as described in Choose a scrubber touch-interaction model.) The system respects your setting for resting position irrespective of the values of the `mode` and `isContinuous` properties.

Specifically:

- `NSScrubber.Alignment.leading` — In a left-to-right language, the scrubber comes to rest, following manual or automatic scrolling, so that the left edge of the leftmost scrubber item is coincident with the left edge of the scrubber.

- `NSScrubber.Alignment.center` — The scrubber comes to rest, following manual or automatic scrolling, so that a scrubber item is perfectly centered in the scrubber.

- `NSScrubber.Alignment.trailing` — In a left-to-right language, the scrubber comes to rest, following manual or automatic scrolling, so that the right edge of the rightmost scrubber item is coincident with the right edge of the scrubber.

- `NSScrubber.Alignment.none` — Following manual or automatic scrolling, the scrubber comes to rest without attempting to align any scrubber item.

### Scrubber layout

A scrubber configures the views for its items with the help of two classes, `NSScrubberLayout` and `NSScrubberLayoutAttributes`, as described in this section.

#### Layout implementation

A _layout_ is a concrete implementation of the `NSScrubberLayout` abstract class. AppKit provides two concrete, preconfigured layout subclasses: `NSScrubberFlowLayout` and `NSScrubberProportionalLayout`. If you use one of these built-in layout types, there’s no additional layout code to write, apart from adding your choice of built-in layout to the scrubber’s `scrubberLayout` property. This Swift example shows this simple step for the flow layout:

myInformationScrubber.scrubberLayout = NSScrubberFlowLayout()

To create a custom layout, subclass the `NSScrubberLayout` class and implement its callback methods. Unlike a view delegate (such as used for a table view), which provides _views_ on demand, scrubber layout callbacks provide _view specifications_ on demand. Using these callbacks, you specify:

- Scrubber item geometry

- Scrubber item appearance

- Layout life cycle for state management

Specify the overall visual dimensions of a custom scrubber when you create it, using the `init(frame:)` or `init(coder:)` initializer, or by using Interface Builder.

Return the total width and height for the elements in a custom scrubber, including those not currently visible, using the `scrubberContentSize` property in your layout. Specify height and width in points. To use the standard height, specify a value of `30`.

Specify the geometry and appearance for items in your custom scrubber, using the two required callback methods that each return instances of the `NSScrubberLayoutAttributes` class. The system calls one or another of these methods, as it needs to, as a user interacts with a layout’s owning scrubber:

| Callback method | How to use |
| --- | --- |
| `layoutAttributesForItem(at:)` | Return _one_ `NSScrubberLayoutAttributes` instance that specifies the view attribute values for the one scrubber item at the index position requested by the system in the method call. |
| `layoutAttributesForItems(in:)` | Return the _set of_ `NSScrubberLayoutAttributes` instances that, together, specify the per-item view attributes for the items within the visible rectangle requested by the system in the method call. The set you return must contain one layout attributes object for each item in the rectangle. |

You can explicitly invalidate a layout by calling the `invalidateLayout()` method. Do this whenever your app changes a scrubber’s information in a way that requires a layout update. For example, if you change the text shown in one or more items, invalidate the layout.

You can specify layout life cycle in terms of the conditions under which a layout should be automatically invalidated, such as when the user selects something different in the layout’s owning scrubber. The API for automatic invalidation consists of the following two properties and one method:

- `shouldInvalidateLayoutForSelectionChange`

- `shouldInvalidateLayoutForHighlightChange`

- `shouldInvalidateLayoutForChange(fromVisibleRect:toVisibleRect:)`

For example, if you design a scrubber’s layout characteristics to depend on which of its items is selected by the user, return a value of `true` from the scrubber’s `shouldInvalidateLayoutForSelectionChange` method.A _layout attributes_ object is an instance of the `NSScrubberLayoutAttributes` class, which you configure to describe the view for a single item. The class offers the following built-in attributes for you to work with:

- `itemIndex` — The item’s index position within the scrubber

- `frame` — The item’s frame rectangle

- `alpha` — The item’s transparency

You can specify additional item attributes by subclassing the `NSScrubberLayoutAttributes` class. For example, you could specify a geometric transform attribute.

If you’re using a custom `NSScrubberLayout` subclass, provide an implementation for the `invalidateLayout()` method to clear any custom layout state, such as by discarding cached data.

#### Prepare for redrawing

The flip side of layout invalidation (as described in Layout implementation) is preparation for redrawing, which you perform in a layout’s `prepare()` method. The goal of layout preparation is to optimize performance. A scrubber calls the `prepare()` method exactly once between invalidation and redrawing. Complete as much one-time, up-front layout work as you can, in advance of redrawing, in this step. For example, your `prepare()` implementation should perform initial layout calculations and should fill caches needed during drawing.

After the `prepare()` method returns, the system updates the scrubber view hierarchy with repeated calls to three `NSScrubberLayout` methods: `layoutAttributesForItem(at:)`, `layoutAttributesForItems(in:)`, and `scrubberContentSize`. Implement these methods to provide return values as quickly as possible, taking advantage of the work you did during layout preparation.

### Scrubber items

The view that represents a scrubber item is provided by your data source object, using the `scrubber(_:viewForItemAt:)` protocol method. AppKit provides two purpose-built view classes you can use, both of which are concrete subclasses of the abstract `NSScrubberItemView` class:

- `NSScrubberImageItemView` has `image`, `imageView`, and `imageAlignment` properties

- `NSScrubberTextItemView` has `textField` and `title` properties

To create a custom item, subclass these or their abstract superclass, `NSScrubberItemView`.

### Scrubbers and the responder chain

To show a scrubber, associate it with an `NSTouchBar` object (adding it, as the view for a custom item or popover item, to the bar) and then associate the bar with the appropriate responder object in your app. The system then shows the scrubber in the Touch Bar only at appropriate times. For more information on bars and the responder chain, read the overview for the `NSTouchBar` class.

### Choose between a scrubber and a scroll view

When choosing between a scrubber and a scroll view, use a scrubber unless the amount of content, or the nature of your content, doesn’t work well in a scrubber. Scrubber interaction is optimized for the Touch Bar, typically making a scrubber the better option for letting the user pick from among several choices, such as dates in a calendar.

Class

# NSResponder

An abstract class that forms the basis of event and command processing in AppKit.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSResponder

## Overview

The core classes— `NSApplication`, `NSWindow`, and `NSView`—inherit from `NSResponder`, as must any class that handles events. The responder model uses three components: event messages, action messages, and the responder chain.

`NSResponder` also plays an important role in the presentation of error information. The default implementations of the `presentError(_:)` and `presentError(_:modalFor:delegate:didPresent:contextInfo:)` methods send `willPresentError(_:)` to `self`, thereby giving subclasses the opportunity to customize the localized information presented in error alerts. `NSResponder` then forwards the message to the next responder, passing it the customized `NSError` object. The exact path up the modified responder chain depends on the type of application window:

`NSApplication` displays a document-modal error alert and, if the error object has a recovery attempter, gives it a chance to recover from the error. A recovery attempter is an object that conforms to the NSErrorRecoveryAttempting informal protocol.

Class

# NSEvent

An object that contains information about an input action, such as a mouse click or a key press.

macOS

class NSEvent

## Overview

AppKit reports events that occur in a window to the app that created the window. Events include mouse clicks, key presses, and other types of input to the system. An `NSEvent` object contains pertinent information about each event, such as the event type and when the event occurred. The event type defines what other information is available in the event object. For example, a keyboard event contains information about the pressed keys.

Although you can create `NSEvent` objects directly, you typically don’t. The system generates them automatically in response to input from the mouse, keyboard, trackpad, or other peripherals such as connected tablets. It enqueues those events in its event queue, and dequeues them when it’s ready to process them. The system delivers events to the most relevant `NSResponder` object, which might be the first responder or the object where the event occurred. For example, the system delivers mouse-click events to the view that contains the event location.

To handle events, add support to your app’s `NSResponder` objects. You can also use gesture recognizers to handle some events for you and execute your app’s code at appropriate times. For more information, see the `NSResponder` reference.

You can also monitor the events your app receives and modify or cancel some events as needed. Install a local monitor using the `addLocalMonitorForEvents(matching:handler:)` method to detect specific types of events and take action when your app receives them. Install a global monitor using the `addGlobalMonitorForEvents(matching:handler:)` method to monitor events systemwide, although without the ability to modify them.

# NSTouch

A snapshot of a particular touch at an instant in time.

class NSTouch

## Overview

A touch event is not persistent throughout the touch. A touch creates new instances as it progresses. Use the identity property to follow a specific touch across its lifetime.

Touches do not have a corresponding screen location. The first touch of a touch collection latches to the view underlying the cursor using the same hit detection as mouse events. Additional touches on the same device latch to the same view. Latches remain on views until the user ends a touch or an event cancels it.

## Topics

- validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)

Instance Method

# validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)

Overridden by subclasses to determine what services are available.

macOS

@MainActor
func validRequestor(
forSendType sendType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType?,
returnType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType?

## Parameters

`sendType`

A string identifying the send type of pasteboard data. May be an empty string (see discussion).

`returnType`

A string identifying the return type of pasteboard data. May be an empty string (see discussion).

## Return Value

If the receiver can place data of `sendType` on the pasteboard and receive data of `returnType`, it should return `self`; otherwise it should return either `[super validRequestorForSendType:returnType:]` or `[[self nextResponder] validRequestorForSendType:returnType:]`, which allows an object higher up in the responder chain to have an opportunity to handle the message.

## Mentioned in

Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

Supporting Continuity Camera in Your Mac App

## Discussion

With each event, and for each service in the Services menu, the application object sends this message up the responder chain with the send and return type for the service being checked. This method is therefore invoked many times per event. The default implementation simply forwards this message to the next responder, ultimately returning `nil`.

Either `sendType` or `returnType`—but not both—may be empty. If `sendType` is empty, the service doesn’t require input from the application requesting the service. If `returnType` is empty, the service doesn’t return data.

Instance Method

# readSelection(from:)

Reads data from the pasteboard and uses it to replace the current selection.

macOS

## Parameters

`pboard`

The pasteboard containing the data to read.

## Return Value

`true` if your implementation was able to read the pasteboard data successfully; otherwise, `false`.

## Mentioned in

Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

Supporting Continuity Camera in Your Mac App

## Discussion

You implement this method to replace your application’s current selection (that is, the text or objects that are currently selected) with the data on the pasteboard. The data would have been placed in the pasteboard by another application in response to a remote message from the Services menu. A `readSelection(from:)` message is sent to the same object that previously received a `writeSelection(to:types:)` message.

Class

# NSMenuItemBadge

A control that provides additional quantitative information specific to a menu item, such as the number of available updates.

class NSMenuItemBadge

## Overview

You create a badge using an initializer or a predefined factory method, and then you assign it to the `badge` property of a `NSMenuItem` for display.

For example, to display a badge with a count, use the `init(count:)` initalizer, passing in the value of `count` as an `Int`.

let menu = NSMenu()

// Create a menu item.
let menuItem = NSMenuItem(title: "Messages", action: nil, keyEquivalent: "")

// Set the badge to display "6".
menuItem.badge = NSMenuItemBadge(count: 6)

// Add the item to the menu.
menu.addItem(menuItem)

NSMenu *menu = [[NSMenu alloc] init];

// Create a menu item.
NSMenuItem *menuItem = [[NSMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Messages" action:nil keyEquivalent:@""];

// Set the badge to display "6".
menuItem.badge = [[NSMenuItemBadge alloc] initWithCount:6];

// Add the item to the menu.
[menu addItem:menuItem];

To display a badge with a custom string, use the `init(string:)` initializer, passing in the string you want to display.

let updateCount = 3
let menu = NSMenu()

// Create a menu item.
let menuItem = NSMenuItem(title: "Changes", action: nil, keyEquivalent: "")

// Set the badge to display "3 changes".
menuItem.badge = NSMenuItemBadge(string: "\(updateCount) changes")

NSInteger updateCount = 3;
NSMenu *menu = [[NSMenu alloc] init];

// Create a menu item.
NSMenuItem *menuItem = [[NSMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Changes" action:nil keyEquivalent:@""];

// Set the badge to display "3 changes".
menuItem.badge = [[NSMenuItemBadge alloc] initWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%ld changes", (long)updateCount]];

To display a badge using a predefined `NSMenuItemBadge.BadgeType`, use a factory method such as `newItems(count:)`, passing in the `count` of the badge to display.

// Add a new items style badge.
let newItemsItem = NSMenuItem(title: "New Items", action: nil, keyEquivalent: "")
newItemsItem.badge = NSMenuItemBadge.newItems(count: 3)
menu.addItem(newItemsItem)

// Add an alerts style badge.
let alertsItem = NSMenuItem(title: "Alerts", action: nil, keyEquivalent: "")
alertsItem.badge = NSMenuItemBadge.alerts(count: 4)
menu.addItem(alertsItem)

// Add an update style badge.
let updatesItem = NSMenuItem(title: "Updates", action: nil, keyEquivalent: "")
updatesItem.badge = NSMenuItemBadge.updates(count: 5)
menu.addItem(updatesItem)

// Add a new items style badge.
NSMenuItem *newItemsItem = [[NSMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"New Items" action:nil keyEquivalent:@""];
newItemsItem.badge = [NSMenuItemBadge newItemsWithCount:3];
[menu addItem:newItemsItem];

// Add an alerts style badge.
NSMenuItem *alertsItem = [[NSMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"New Items" action:nil keyEquivalent:@""];
alertsItem.badge = [NSMenuItemBadge alertsWithCount:4];
[menu addItem:alertsItem];

// Add an update style badge.
NSMenuItem *updatesItem = [[NSMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Updates" action:nil keyEquivalent:@""];
updatesItem.badge = [NSMenuItemBadge updatesWithCount:5];
[menu addItem:updatesItem];

The default value of this property is `nil`.

Class

# NSStatusBar

An object that manages a collection of status items displayed within the system-wide menu bar.

macOS

class NSStatusBar

## Overview

A status item (an instance of `NSStatusItem`) can be displayed with text or an icon, can provide a menu and a target-action message when clicked, or can be a fully customized view that you create. Use status items sparingly and only if the alternatives (such as a Dock menu, preference pane, or status window) are not suitable. Because there is limited space in which to display status items, status items are not guaranteed to be available at all times. For this reason, do not rely on them being available and always provide a user preference for hiding your application’s status items to free up space in the menu bar.

## Topics

### Getting the System-Wide Instance

`class var system: NSStatusBar`

Returns the system-wide status bar located in the menu bar.

### Managing Status items

Returns a newly created status item that has been allotted a specified space within the status bar.

`func removeStatusItem(NSStatusItem)`

In macOS 10.3 and later, cursor size is no longer limited to 16 by 16 pixels.

### Cursor Rectangles

In Cocoa, you can change the currently displayed cursor based on the position of the mouse over one of your views. You might use this technique to provide visual feedback about what actions the user can take with the mouse. For example, you might display one of the resize cursors whenever the mouse moves over a portion of your view that acts as a custom resizing handle. To set this up, you associate a cursor object with one or more cursor rectangles in the view.

Cursor rectangles are a specialized type of tracking rectangles, which are used to monitor the mouse location in a view. Views implement cursor rectangles using tracking rectangles but provide methods for setting and refreshing cursor rectangles that are distinct from the generic tracking rectangle interface. For information on how to set up cursor rectangles, see Mouse-Tracking and Cursor-Update Events.

### Balancing Cursor Hiding and Unhiding

Each call to `hide()` cursor must have a corresponding `unhide()` call. For example,

[NSCursor hide];
[NSCursor hide];
// ...
[NSCursor unhide];

Will result in the cursor still being hidden because the `hide` and `unhide` method invocations are not balanced. Instead you must balance the method calls, such as in the following example:

[NSCursor hide];
[NSCursor hide];
// ...
[NSCursor unhide];
[NSCursor unhide];

There are corresponding cursor `hide` and `unhide` calls, thus the cursor will become visible.

Class

# NSTrackingArea

A region of a view that generates mouse-tracking and cursor-update events when the pointer is over that region.

class NSTrackingArea

## Overview

When creating a tracking-area object, you specify a rectangle (in the view’s coordinate system), an owning object, and one or more options, along with (optionally) a dictionary of data. After it’s created, you add the tracking-area object to a view using the `addTrackingArea(_:)` method. Depending on the options specified, the owner of the tracking area receives `mouseEntered(with:)`, `mouseExited(with:)`, `mouseMoved(with:)`, and `cursorUpdate(with:)` messages when the mouse cursor enters, moves within, and leaves the tracking area. Currently the tracking area is restricted to rectangles.

An `NSTrackingArea` object belongs to its view rather than to its window. Consequently, you can add and remove tracking rectangles without needing to worry if the view has been added to a window. In addition, this design makes it possible for the AppKit to compute the geometry of tracking areas automatically when a view moves and, in some cases, when a view changes size.

Using `NSTrackingArea`, you can configure the scope of activity for mouse tracking. There are four options:

- The tracking area is active only when the view is first responder.

- The tracking area is active when the view is in the key window.

- The tracking area is active when the application is active.

- The tracking area is active always (even when the application is inactive).

Other options for `NSTrackingArea` objects include specifying that the tracking area should be synchronized with the visible rectangle of the view ( `visibleRect`) and for generating `mouseEntered:` and `mouseExited`: events when the mouse is dragged.

Other `NSView` methods related to `NSTrackingArea` objects (in addition to `addTrackingArea(_:)`) include `removeTrackingArea(_:)` and `updateTrackingAreas()`. Views can override the latter method to recompute and replace their `NSTrackingArea` objects in certain situations, such as a change in the size of the `visibleRect`.

## Topics

### Initializing the Tracking-Area Object

[`init(rect: NSRect, options: NSTrackingArea.Options, owner: Any?, userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]?)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/init(rect:options:owner:userinfo:))

Initializes and returns an object defining a region of a view to receive mouse-tracking events, mouse-moved events, cursor-update events, or possibly all these events.

### Getting Object Attributes

`var options: NSTrackingArea.Options`

The options specified for the receiver.

`var owner: AnyObject?`

The object owning the receiver, which is the recipient of mouse-tracking, mouse-movement, and cursor-update messages.

`var rect: NSRect`

The rectangle defining the area encompassed by the receiver.

[`var userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/userinfo)

The dictionary containing the data associated with the receiver when it was created.

### Constants

`struct Options`

The data type defined for the constants specified in the `options` parameter of `init(rect:options:owner:userInfo:)`. These constants are described below; you can specify multiple constants by performing a bitwise-OR operation with them. In particular, you must supply one or more of the tracking-type constants (that is, `mouseEnteredAndExited`, `mouseMoved`, and `cursorUpdate`) and one of the active constants (that is, `activeWhenFirstResponder`, `activeInKeyWindow`, `activeInActiveApp`, and `activeAlways`). In addition, you may specify any of the behavior constants (that is, `assumeInside`, `inVisibleRect`, and `enabledDuringMouseDrag`).

- AppKit
- NSDockTile

Class

# NSDockTile

The visual representation of your app’s miniaturized windows and app icon as they appear in the Dock.

class NSDockTile

## Overview

You do not create Dock tile objects explicitly in your app. Instead, you retrieve the Dock tile for an existing window or for the app by calling that object’s `dockTile` method. Also, you do not subclass the `NSDockTile` class; instead, you use the methods of the class to make the following customizations:

- Badge the tile with a custom string.

- Remove or show the application icon badge.

- Draw the tile content yourself.

If you decide to draw the tile content yourself, you must provide a custom content view to handle the drawing.

### Application Dock Tiles

An application Dock tile defaults to display the application’s `applicationIconImage`.

The application Dock tile never shows a smaller application icon badge.

Whether using the default or custom view, the application Dock tile may be badged with a short custom string.

### Window Dock Tiles

A window Dock tile defaults to display a miniaturized version of the windows contents with a badge derived from the application Dock icon, including any customized application Dock icon. The default window Dock tile image may not be badged with a custom string.

A window Dock tile can use a custom view to draw the Dock icon. If a custom view is used, no application badge will be added, but the text label will be overlaid on top of the icon.

## Topics

### Drawing the Tile’s Content

`var contentView: NSView?`

The view to use for drawing the dock tile contents.

### Getting the Tile Information

`var size: NSSize`

The size of the tile.

`var owner: AnyObject?`

The object represented by the dock tile.

### Applying Badge Icons to the Tile

`var showsApplicationBadge: Bool`

A Boolean showing whether the tile is badged with the application’s icon

`var badgeLabel: String?`

The string to be displayed in the tile’s badging area.

### Updating the Dock Tile

`func display()`

Redraws the dock tile’s content.

### Constants

Protocol

# NSDockTilePlugIn

A set of methods implemented by plug-ins that allow an app’s Dock tile to be customized while the app is not running.

macOS

protocol NSDockTilePlugIn : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Customizing an application’s Dock tile when the application itself is not running requires that you write a plug-in. The plug-in’s principal class must implement the `NSDockTilePlugIn` protocol.

The name of the plugin is indicated by a `NSDockTilePlugIn` key in the application’s `Info.plist` file.

The plugin is loaded in a system process at login time or when the application tile is added to the Dock. When the plugin is loaded, the principal class’ implementation of `setDockTile(_:)` is invoked, passing an `NSDockTile` for the plug-in to customize. If the principal class implements `dockMenu()` it is invoked whenever the user causes the application’s dock menu to be shown. When the dock tile is no longer valid (for example,. the application has been removed from the dock) - `setDockTile(_:)` is invoked with `nil`.

## Topics

### Setting the Dock Tile

`func setDockTile(NSDockTile?)`

Invoked when the plug-in is first loaded and when the application is removed from the Dock.

**Required**

### Getting the Dock Tile Menu

Invoked when the user causes the application’s dock menu to be shown.

Class

# NSSound

A simple interface for loading and playing audio files.

macOS

class NSSound

## Overview

You create a sound object with an audio file or data, which can be in any format that Core Audio supports. Customize the sound by configuring its properties, such as setting its playback volume and looping behavior. Call the sound’s `play()` method to begin playback. The system executes this call asynchronously so that it doesn’t interrupt the functioning of your app.

If you want to play the system beep sound, use the `beep()` (Swift) or `NSBeep` (Objective-C) function.

Class

# NSSpeechRecognizer

The Cocoa interface to speech recognition in macOS.

macOS

class NSSpeechRecognizer

## Overview

`NSSpeechRecognizer` provides a “command and control” style of voice recognition system, where the command phrases must be defined prior to listening, in contrast to a dictation system where the recognized text is unconstrained. Through an `NSSpeechRecognizer` instance, Cocoa apps can use the speech recognition engine built into macOS to recognize spoken commands. With speech recognition, users can accomplish complex tasks with spoken commands—for example, “Move pawn B2 to B4” and “Take back move.”

The `NSSpeechRecognizer` class has a property that lets you specify which spoken words should be recognized as commands ( `commands`) and methods that let you start and stop listening ( `startListening()` and `stopListening()`). When the speech recognition facility recognizes one of the designated commands, `NSSpeechRecognizer` invokes the delegation method `speechRecognizer(_:didRecognizeCommand:)`, allowing the delegate to perform the command.

Speech recognition is just one of the macOS speech technologies. The speech synthesis technology allows applications to “pronounce” written text in U.S. English and over 25 other languages, with a number of different voices and dialects for each language ( `NSSpeechSynthesizer` is the Cocoa interface to this technology). Both speech technologies provide benefits for all users, and are particularly useful to those users who have difficulties seeing the screen or using the mouse and keyboard. By incorporating speech into your application, you can provide a concurrent mode of interaction for your users: In macOS, your software can accept input and provide output without requiring users to change their working context.

## Topics

### Creating Speech Recognizers

`init?()`

Initializes and returns an instance of the `NSSpeechRecognizer` class.

### Handling the Recognition of a Spoken Command

`var delegate: (any NSSpeechRecognizerDelegate)?`

The delegate for the speech recognizer object.

`protocol NSSpeechRecognizerDelegate`

A set of optional methods implemented by delegates of `NSSpeechRecognizer` objects.

### Configuring Speech Recognizers

[`var commands: [String]?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsspeechrecognizer/commands)

An array of strings defining the commands for which the speech recognizer object should listen.

`var displayedCommandsTitle: String?`

The title of the commands section in the Speech Commands window or `nil` if there is no title.

`var listensInForegroundOnly: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the speech recognizer object should only enable its commands when its application is the frontmost one.

`var blocksOtherRecognizers: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the speech recognizer object should block all other recognizers (that is, other applications attempting to understand spoken commands) when listening.

### Listening

`func startListening()`

Tells the speech recognition engine to begin listening for commands.

`func stopListening()`

Tells the speech recognition engine to suspend listening for commands.

class NSSpeechSynthesizer

## Overview

Speech synthesis, also called text-to-speech (TTS), parses text and converts it into audible speech. It offers a concurrent feedback mode that can be used in concert with or in place of traditional visual and aural notifications. For example, your application can use a speech synthesizer object to “pronounce” the text of important alert dialogs. Synthesized speech has several advantages. It can provide urgent information to users without forcing them to shift attention from their current task. And because speech doesn’t rely on visual elements for meaning, it is a crucial technology for users with vision or attention disabilities.

In addition, synthesized speech can help save system resources. Because sound samples can take up large amounts of room on disk, using text in place of sampled sound is extremely efficient, and so a multimedia application might use an `NSSpeechSynthesizer` object to provide a narration of a QuickTime movie instead of including sampled-sound data on a movie track.

Speech synthesis is just one of the macOS speech technologies. The speech recognizer technology allows applications to “listen to” text spoken in U.S. English; the `NSSpeechRecognizer` class is the Cocoa interface to this technology. Both technologies provide benefits for all users, and are particularly useful to those users who have difficulties seeing the screen or using the mouse and keyboard.

### Speech Feedback Window

The speech feedback window ( Figure 1) displays the text recognized from the user’s speech and the text from which an `NSSpeechSynthesizer` object synthesizes speech. Using the feedback window makes spoken exchange more natural and helps the user understand the synthesized speech.

For example, your application may use an `NSSpeechRecognizer` object to listen for the command “Play some music.” When it recognizes this command, your application might then respond by speaking “Which artist?” using a speech synthesizer.

class NSAlignmentFeedbackFilter

## Overview

With a Force Touch trackpad, apps can produce tactile feed class to filter object movements and provide haptic feed

To implement alignment feedback in your custom alignment controller class, set up the class to receive events for tracking the movement of an object. These can be events matching the `inputEventMask` value of an `NSAlignmentFeedbackFilter` object, or events from a gesture recognizer ( `NSGestureRecognizer`). For each event received:

1. Create an instance of an `NSAlignmentFeedbackFilter` object. For example:

let self.feedbackFilter = NSAlignmentFeedbackFilter()

self.feedbackFilter = [NSAlignmentFeedbackFilter new];

2. Inform the alignment feedback filter object about the event. To do this, call one of the following methods:

- `update(with:)`

- `update(withPanRecognizer:)`

3. Store the location of the object before it moves in response to the event. This is considered the _previous_ location of the object.

4. Move the object to its new location in response to the event. This is the location where the object will reside if no alignment occurs.

5. Store the new location of the object. This is considered the _default_ location of the object.

6. Determine where the object will move to be aligned. This is considered the _aligned_ location of the object.

7. Request a feedback token based on the previous location, default location, and aligned location. To do this, call one of the following methods:

- `alignmentFeedbackTokenForMovement(in:previousPoint:alignedPoint:defaultPoint:)` \- If the object will be moved both horizontally and vertically to become aligned.

- `alignmentFeedbackTokenForHorizontalMovement(in:previousX:alignedX:defaultX:)` \- If the object will be moved horizontally only to become aligned.

- `alignmentFeedbackTokenForVerticalMovement(in:previousY:alignedY:defaultY:)` \- If the object will be moved vertically only to become aligned.

8. If a feedback token is successfully prepared, call `performFeedback(_:performanceTime:)` to perform the haptic feedback. Then, move the object to the aligned location.

If a value of `null` is returned, rather than a feedback token, then the system has determined that alignment and feedback are not appropriate. Perhaps the cursor is moving too fast or the distance to the aligned location is not significant enough to produce a visual snap. Move the object to its default location.

Class

# NSGestureRecognizer

An object that monitors events and calls its action method when a predefined sequence of events occur.

@MainActor
class NSGestureRecognizer

## Overview

A gesture recognizer might recognize a single click, a click and drag, or a sequence of events that imply rotation. You do not create instances of this class directly. This class is an abstract base class that defines the common behavior for all gesture recognizers. When using a gesture recognizer in your app, create an instance of one of the concrete subclasses.

The concrete subclasses of `NSGestureRecognizer` are the following:

- `NSClickGestureRecognizer`

- `NSMagnificationGestureRecognizer`

- `NSPanGestureRecognizer`

- `NSPressGestureRecognizer`

- `NSRotationGestureRecognizer`

A gesture recognizer operates on events in a specific view (or in any of that view’s subviews). After creating a gesture recognizer, attach it to one of your views using the `addGestureRecognizer(_:)` method. Events received by your app are forwarded automatically to any relevant gesture recognizers before they are sent to the corresponding view. The gesture recognizer can delay the further progression of the events until recognition is complete or allow the events to be delivered normally.

A gesture recognizer can detect gestures that are either discrete or continuous in nature. A click gesture is discrete because it involves a mouse-down and mouse-up event without any mouse movements in between. By contrast, a pan or rotation gesture is continuous because it involves tracking mouse movements over a period of time.

During the gesture recognition process, a gesture recognizer calls the action method of its associated target object to report the state of the recognition process. For discrete gestures, the action method is typically called only once when the gesture is recognized. For continuous gestures, it may be called multiple times depending on the current state of the gesture recognizer. In that situation, you can use your action method to perform appropriate tasks, such as creating animations for any mouse-related movements, in addition to handling the final results of the gesture recognition process.

A gesture recognizer has only one action method and one target object, and the method must conform to one of the following signatures:

func handleGesture() { }
func handleGesture(gestureRecognizer: NSGestureRecognizer) { }

- (void)handleGesture;
- (void)handleGesture:(NSGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer;

When your code needs additional information about the particulars of a gesture, define your action method to include the gesture recognizer parameter. You almost always want the gesture recognizer object when handling continuous gestures. For example, for a rotation gesture, you would use the gesture recognizer object to get the updated rotation value. You can also use the gesture recognizer object to get the location of where the gesture occurred.

### State Transitions

Gesture recognizers operate within a predefined state machine, transitioning from state to state as they handle events. All gesture recognizers begin in the Possible ( `NSGestureRecognizer.State.possible`) state, but the possible transitions differ for continuous and discrete gestures.

Discrete gestures transition from the Possible state directly to the Recognized ( `recognized`) or Failed ( `NSGestureRecognizer.State.failed`) state, depending on whether they successfully interpret the gesture. When a discrete gesture recognizer transitions to the Recognized state, it calls the action method of its target object.

For continuous gestures, the state transitions are as follows:

The Changed state is optional and may occur multiple times before the Cancelled or Ended state is reached. Many state transitions cause the gesture recognizer to call its action method. Setting the `state` property to `NSGestureRecognizer.State.changed` while monitoring events also calls the action method. You can use these calls to update the state of your app or update any custom animations.

For a list of possible states, see the constants in `NSGestureRecognizer.State`.

### Subclassing Notes

You may create a subclass of `NSGestureRecognizer` that recognizes a distinctive gesture—for example, a “check mark” gesture. A custom gesture recognizer implements any appropriate event-related methods to detect its gesture along with a few other methods for managing state information.

All gesture recognizers must update the value in the state property at appropriate times. Specifically, you must update it for all state transitions. For more information about the possible state transitions of a gesture recognizer, see State Transitions.

#### Methods to Override

When creating your own gesture recognizer subclass:

- Implement the `reset()` method and any other relevant methods in Methods for Subclasses.

- Override the `location(in:)` method as needed to specify an appropriate point for your gesture.

AppKit waits for a mouse-down event, magnify event, or rotation event to occur before starting the gesture recognition process. A gesture recognizer that used only key-down events to recognize its gesture would not have its `keyDown(with:)` method called until a mouse-down, magnify, or rotation event started the recognition process.

#### Alternatives to Subclassing

The `NSGestureRecognizer` class defines the common behaviors that can be configured for all concrete gesture recognizers. It also supports a delegate—an object that adopts the `NSGestureRecognizerDelegate` protocol—for handling finer-grained customization of some behaviors without the need for subclassing. For example, you can use the delegate to create dependencies between specific gesture recognizer objects.

For more information about using the delegate to control the behavior of your gesture recognizers, see `NSGestureRecognizerDelegate`.

A set of methods that restoration classes must implement to handle the recreation of windows.

macOS

protocol NSWindowRestoration : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

At launch time, the application object retrieves the restoration class and uses its `restoreWindow(withIdentifier:state:completionHandler:)` method to obtain a new window whose type matches the type that was preserved previously. Classes that adopt this protocol can use the provided information to create (or obtain a reference to) the window in the new application. As part of creating the window, the class should also create any related objects, such as window controllers, normally used to manage the window.

Class

# NSScreen

An object that describes the attributes of a computer’s monitor or screen.

macOS

class NSScreen

## Overview

An app may use an `NSScreen` object to retrieve information about a screen and use this information to decide what to display on that screen. For example, an app may use the `deepest` method to find out which of the available screens can best represent color and then might choose to display all of its windows on that screen.

Create the application object before you use the methods in this class, so that the application object can make the necessary connection to the window system. You can make sure the application object exists by invoking the `shared` method of `NSApplication`. If you created your app with Xcode, the application object is automatically created for you during initialization.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspopover

- AppKit

Class

# NSPopover

A means to display additional content related to existing content on the screen.

@MainActor
class NSPopover

## Overview

The popover is positioned relative to the existing content and an anchor is used to express the relation between these two units of content. A popover has an appearance that specifies its visual characteristics, as well as a behavior that determines which user interactions will cause the popover to close. A transient popover is closed in response to most user interactions, whereas a semi-transient popover is closed when the user interacts with the window containing the popover’s positioning view. Popovers with application-defined behavior are not usually closed on the developer’s behalf.

The system automatically positions each popover relative to its positioning view and moves the popover whenever its positioning view moves. A positioning rectangle within the positioning view can be specified for additional granularity.

Popovers can be detached to become a separate window when they are dragged by implementing the appropriate delegate method.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert

- AppKit
- NSAlert

Class

# NSAlert

A modal dialog or sheet attached to a document window.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSAlert

## Overview

The methods of the `NSAlert` class allow you to specify alert level, alert text, button titles, and a custom icon should you require it. The class also lets your alerts display a help button and provides ways for apps to offer help specific to an alert.

To display an alert as a sheet, call the `beginSheetModal(for:completionHandler:)` method; to display one as an app-modal dialog, use the `runModal()` method.

By design, an `NSAlert` object is intended for a single alert—that is, an alert with a unique combination of title, buttons, and so on—that is displayed upon a particular condition. You should create an `NSAlert` object for each alert dialog, creating it only when you need to display an alert, and release it when you are done. If you have a particular alert dialog that you need to show repeatedly, you can retain and reuse an instance of `NSAlert` for this dialog.

After creating an alert using one of the alert creation methods, you can customize it further prior to displaying it by customizing its attributes. See Instance Attributes.

Unless you must maintain compatibility with existing alert-processing code that uses the function-based API, you should allocate ( `alloc`) and initialize ( `init`) the alert object, and then set its attributes using the appropriate methods of the `NSAlert` class.

### Instance Attributes

`NSAlert` objects have the following attributes:

- Type An alert’s type helps convey the importance or gravity of its message to the user. Specified with the `alertStyle` property.

- Message text The main message of the alert. Specified with `messageText`.

- Informative text Additional information about the alert. Specified with `informativeText`.

- Icon An optional, custom icon to display in the alert, which is used instead of the default app icon. Specified with `icon`.

- Help Alerts can let the user get help about them. Use `helpAnchor` and `showsHelp`.

- Response buttons By default an alert has one response button: the OK button. You can add more response buttons using the `addButton(withTitle:)` method.

- Suppression checkbox A suppression checkbox allows the user to suppress the display of a particular alert in subsequent occurrences of the event that triggers it. Use `showsSuppressionButton`.

- Accessory view An accessory view lets you add additional information to an alert; for example, a text field with contact information. Use `accessoryView`, `layout()`.

### Subclassing Notes

The `NSAlert` class is not designed for subclassing.

## Topics

### Creating Alerts

`init(error: any Error)`

Returns an alert initialized from information in an error object.

### Configuring Alerts

`func layout()`

Specifies that the alert must do immediate layout instead of lazily just before display.

`var alertStyle: NSAlert.Style`

Indicates the alert’s severity level.

`var accessoryView: NSView?`

The alert’s accessory view.

`var showsHelp: Bool`

Specifies whether the alert has a help button.

`var helpAnchor: NSHelpManager.AnchorName?`

The alert’s HTML help anchor.

`var delegate: (any NSAlertDelegate)?`

The alert’s delegate.

### Displaying Alerts

Runs the alert as an app-modal dialog and returns the constant that identifies the button clicked.

Runs the alert modally as a sheet attached to the specified window.

`func beginSheetModal(for: NSWindow, modalDelegate: Any?, didEnd: Selector?, contextInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?)`

Runs the alert modally as an alert sheet attached to a specified window.

Deprecated

`var suppressionButton: NSButton?`

The alert’s suppression checkbox.

`var showsSuppressionButton: Bool`

Specifies whether the alert includes a suppression checkbox, which you can employ to allow a user to opt out of seeing the alert again.

### Accessing Alert Text

`var informativeText: String`

The alert’s informative text.

`var messageText: String`

The alert’s message text or title.

### Accessing a Custom Alert Icon

`var icon: NSImage!`

The custom icon displayed in the alert.

### Accessing Alert Response Buttons

[`var buttons: [NSButton]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/buttons)

The array of response buttons for the alert.

Adds a button with a given title to the alert.

### Getting Alert Windows

`var window: NSWindow`

The app-modal panel or document-modal sheet that corresponds to the alert.

### Constants

`enum Style`

The set of alert styles to style alerts in your app.

`struct ModalResponse`

Class

# NSOpenPanel

A panel that prompts the user to select a file to open.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSOpenPanel

## Overview

Apps use the Open panel as a convenient way to query the user for the name of a file to open. In macOS 10.15 and later, the system always draws Open panels in a separate process, regardless of whether the app is sandboxed. When the user chooses a file to open, macOS adds that file to the app’s sandbox. Prior to macOS 10.15, the system drew the panels in a separate process only for sandboxed apps.

## Topics

### Configuring the Open Panel

`var canChooseFiles: Bool`

A Boolean that indicates whether the user can choose files in the panel.

`var canChooseDirectories: Bool`

A Boolean that indicates whether the user can choose directories in the panel.

Class

# NSSavePanel

A panel that prompts the user for information about where to save a file.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSSavePanel

## Overview

The Save panel provides an interface for specifying the location to save a file and the name of that file. You present this panel when the user attempts to save a new document, or when the user saves a copy of an existing document to a new location. The panel includes UI for browsing the file system, selecting a directory, and specifying the new name for the file. You can also add custom UI for your app using an accessory view.

An `NSSavePanel` object reports user interactions to its associated `delegate` object, which must adopt the `NSOpenSavePanelDelegate` protocol. Use your delegate object to validate the user’s selection and respond to user interactions with the panel.

In macOS 10.15, the system always displays the Save dialog in a separate process, regardless of whether the app is sandboxed. When the user saves the document, macOS adds the saved file to the app’s sandbox (if necessary) so that the app can write to the file. Prior to macOS 10.15, the system used a separate process only for sandboxed apps.

- AppKit
- NSAccessibilityProtocol

Protocol

# NSAccessibilityProtocol

The complete list of properties and methods for accessible elements.

macOS

protocol NSAccessibilityProtocol : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

To be accessible, an app must provide information to the assistive app about its user interface and capabilities. There are three ways that apps and assistive apps interact:

- Informational properties. `NSAccessibilityProtocol` defines a number of properties that provide information about your view or control. If you’re working with a subclass of a standard AppKit view or control, you can either set the desired property or override its getters and setters. By default, overriding only the getter tells the assistive app that it has read-only access to the property. Overriding the setter tells the assistive app that it also has write access to the property.

- Action methods. `NSAccessibilityProtocol` also defines a number of methods that simulate button presses, mouse clicks, and selections in your view or control. By implementing these methods, you give assistive apps the ability to drive your view or control.

- Notifications. Your view or control may need to let the assistive app know when changes occur. `NSAccessibility.Notification` defines a number of notifications that you can send using the `post(element:notification:)` method. The role-specific protocols don’t include these notifications; however, standard AppKit controls already send appropriate messages for their standard usage patterns. You typically need to send your own notifications only when you’re creating a custom control or when you’re using a standard control in a nonstandard way.

If you’re using standard AppKit user interface elements, much of the work has been done for you. AppKit views and controls adopt the `NSAccessibilityProtocol` protocol by default. In particular, `NSView`, `NSWindow`, `NSCell`, and `NSDrawer` provide a default implementation for all the properties and methods in this protocol. In some cases, you may need to modify these default values to better represent your app, to provide additional context, or to modify the user’s flow through the app.

If you’re using custom view or control subclasses, you need to add the appropriate informational properties, action methods, and notifications. You do this by adopting a role-specific protocol instead of `NSAccessibilityProtocol`. See Custom Controls.

If you’re using custom user interface elements that don’t inherit from `NSView` or one of the other accessibility-enabled AppKit classes, subclass the `NSAccessibilityElement` class instead of adopting instead of `NSAccessibilityProtocol`.

### Customizing User Interface Elements

Often, you can adjust how an assistive app interacts with your user interface element without creating a custom subclass. If a user interface element inherits from `NSView` or one of the other accessibility-enabled AppKit classes, you can customize it by:

- Setting its accessibility values using any of the setter methods in the `NSAccessibilityProtocol` protocol.

- Overriding any of the properties or methods in the `NSAccessibilityProtocol` protocol with a custom implementation.

If you override a getter method, the system lets assistive apps call your getter. This can be particularly useful when managing dynamic properties because you can calculate their current value on demand instead of trying to update the property in response to a change.

If you override a setter method, the system lets assistive apps both read and modify that property.

You can control which accessor methods the assistive app can use by overriding `isAccessibilitySelectorAllowed(_:)`. Return `true` if the assistive app can call the selector; otherwise, return `false`.

# Custom Controls

Support accessibility for custom user interface elements by adopting a role-specific protocol and implementing its methods.

## Overview

Role-specific accessibility protocols represent the most common control types found in apps. Adopt a role-specific accessibility protocol if:

- You’re creating a custom control that’s a subclass of `NSView`, and you want to modify the control’s behavior beyond what AppKit provides by default.

- You’re working with a specialized control that doesn’t subclass `NSView`. See `NSAccessibilityElement` first.

First, identify the role-specific protocol that best matches your control’s intended behavior. For example, if your control is something that triggers actions when the user clicks it, adopt the `NSAccessibilityButton` protocol.

After you select an appropriate protocol, adopt that protocol. The compiler may ask you to reimplement some of the `NSAccessibilityProtocol` protocol’s accessor or action methods. Simply implement these methods, and your control is ready to use.

# NSAccessibilityElement

The basic infrastructure necessary for interacting with an assistive app.

class NSAccessibilityElement

## Overview

Create subclasses of the `NSAccessibilityElement` class to represent any of your user interface elements that don’t inherit from `NSView` or from one of the standard AppKit controls. This class represents your user interface element in the accessibility hierarchy and manages the details necessary for working with assistive apps.

To support accessibility features for a custom user interface element:

1. Create your `NSAccessibilityElement` subclass by using `element(withRole:frame:label:parent:)`. You can also set these values using `setAccessibilityRole(_:)`, `setAccessibilityLabel(_:)` and `setAccessibilityParent(_:)`.

2. Call the parent’s `accessibilityAddChildElement(_:)` method to add your subclass. You can also add the subclass to its parent’s `accessibilityChildren` array using `setAccessibilityChildren(_:)`.

3. In your subclass, call `setAccessibilityFrameInParentSpace(_:)`. This ensures that your control moves with its superview.

4. In your subclass, adopt a role-specific protocol, customize the role, and post notifications just as you would handle any other accessible control. See Custom Controls.

5. In your subclass, implement any additional properties and methods you may need to use to further customize your user interface element’s accessibility behavior. See `NSAccessibilityProtocol`.

# Accessibility Functions

Global accessibility functions for custom views and controls.

## Overview

Use these `NSAccessibility` functions to enhance the accessibility experience of your custom view or control. Standard AppKit elements handle this behavior for you.

### Notifications

Your custom view or control may need to let the assistive app know when changes occur. For example, if your control’s value changes, you need to send a `valueChanged` notification.

`NSAccessibility.Notification` defines a number of notifications that you can send using the `post(element:notification:)` method. You typically need to send your own notifications only when you’re creating a custom control or when you’re using a standard control in a nonstandard way. Make sure you’re posting any relevant notifications as your control’s state changes.

## Topics

Protocol

# NSDraggingDestination

A set of methods that the destination object (or recipient) of a dragged image must implement.

macOS

protocol NSDraggingDestination : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

The destination automatically receives `NSDraggingDestination` messages for pasteboard data types it has registered for as an image enters, moves around inside, and then exits or is released within the destination’s boundaries.

In macOS 10.7 and later `NSDraggingDestination` is a formal protocol with an updated interface. The OS X v10.6 behavior has been retained, but will be dropped in a future version of the operating system. The methods that are to be deprecated are marked as such.

## Topics

### Managing a Dragging Session Before an Image Is Released

Invoked when the dragged image enters destination bounds or frame; delegate returns dragging operation to perform.

Asks the destination object whether it wants to receive periodic `draggingUpdated(_:)` messages.

Invoked periodically as the image is held within the destination area, allowing modification of the dragging operation or mouse-pointer position.

`func draggingExited((any NSDraggingInfo)?)`

Invoked when the dragged image exits the destination’s bounds rectangle (in the case of a view object) or its frame rectangle (in the case of a window object).

`func draggingEnded(any NSDraggingInfo)`

Called when a drag operation ends.

### Managing a Dragging Session After an Image Is Released

Invoked when the image is released, allowing the receiver to agree to or refuse drag operation.

Invoked after the released image has been removed from the screen, signaling the receiver to import the pasteboard data.

`func concludeDragOperation((any NSDraggingInfo)?)`

Invoked when the dragging operation is complete, signaling the receiver to perform any necessary clean-up.

### Updating Dragging Images

`func updateDraggingItemsForDrag((any NSDraggingInfo)?)`

Invoked when the dragging images should be changed.

Class

# NSDraggingItem

A single dragged item within a dragging session.

class NSDraggingItem

## Overview

`NSDraggingItem` objects have extremely limited lifetimes. Don’t retain these items because changing outside of the prescribed lifetimes has no impact on the drag.

When you call the `NSDraggingSession` method `beginDraggingSession(with:event:source:)`, the system immediately consumes the dragging items that pass to the method, and doesn’t retain them. Any further changes to the dragging item associated with the returned `NSDraggingSession` must occur with the enumeration method `enumerateDraggingItems(options:for:classes:searchOptions:using:)`. When enumerating, the system creates `NSDraggingItem` instances right before giving them to the enumeration block. After returning from the block, the dragging item is no longer valid.

## Overview

Spring-loading is the act of dragging an object onto a destination object and hovering or force-clicking to activate the destination object A view can be configured as a drag-and-drop destination, a spring-loading destination, or both. If a view implements both drag-and-drop and spring-loading, then it will receive messages for both operations.

Note that the view beneath the cursor during a drag receives priority. For example, if a parent view implements drag-and-drop and a subview implements spring-loading, then the parent view will not receive drag-and-drop messages while the cursor is over the subview.

# Applying Apple HDR effect to your photos

You can decode and apply Apple’s HDR gain map to your own images.

## Overview

You can apply Apple high dynamic range (HDR) effect to digital photography images without using Apple SDKs. You compute the Apple HDR gain map from the image’s auxiliary data and then apply it to the image. The _Apple HDR gain map_ is an 8-bit, single-channel luminance map that’s stored with an image.

### Extract the existing HDR gain map from the image

Get the existing HDR gain map from the image’s auxiliary data using the `urn:com:apple:photo:2020:aux:hdrgainmap` image data type. The gain map is untagged and formatted as linear data. It’s encoded using the Rec.709 transfer function and is 1/4 the resolution of the original image.

For example, using Apple APIs, you can extract the gain map from a `CGImage` object by passing `kCGImageAuxiliaryDataTypeHDRGainMap` to the `CGImageSourceCopyAuxiliaryDataInfoAtIndex(_:_:_:)` function.

### Calculate the headroom from the image metadata

Write code that computes the headroom you need to change the dynamic range image. The headroom is the ratio of the luminance of the image’s brightest white to the luminance of standard dynamic range (SDR) white, in the image’s native color space.

Before you begin, check whether the image’s metadata contains the `HDRGainMapVersion` key. If this key exists in the metadata, the gain map is valid and you can continue calculating the headroom.

Next, extract the `MakerNote` dictionary from the image’s metadata. If the `MakerNote` dictionary contains the `33` and `48` keys and they’re set to 32-bit float values, the HDR gain map is valid and you can use it to calculate the headroom.

To compute the headroom, use the following Swift code snippet or rewrite this code in your preferred language:

// Extract the metadata keys from the image.
let (maker33, maker48) = getMetadataFromImage()
let stops: Float

// Convert the metadata to the number of stops
// (factors of 2) that the gain map should apply
// to the image.
if maker33 < 1.0 {
if maker48 <= 0.01 {
stops = -20.0 * maker48 + 1.8
} else {
stops = -0.101 * maker48 + 1.601
}
} else {
if maker48 <= 0.01 {
stops = -70.0*maker48 + 3.0
} else {
stops = -0.303*maker48 + 2.303
}
}

// Convert the stops to linear headroom.
let headroom = pow(2.0, max(stops, 0.0))

### Apply the HDR gain map to the image

Before you apply the HDR gain map to the image, perform the following steps:

1. Resize the gain map by scaling it so it matches the size of the original image.

2. Linearize the gain map by inverting the gain map gamma using the Rec.709 transfer function.

3. Linearize the SDR RGB image by inverting the gamma of the image according to the colorspace.

Then use the headroom value you calculated previously to scale the gain map to the correct level and multiply it into each channel of the image as follows:

let sdr_rgb = ... // A pixel of the SDR image.
let gainmap = ... // A pixel of the gain map.

let hdr_rgb = sdr_rgb * (1.0 + (headroom - 1.0) * gainmap)

The result of applying the gain map is a linear HDR image with a scale where `1.0` is the reference white and the peak value is no greater than the headroom value.

Class

# NSImage

A high-level interface for manipulating image data.

macOS

class NSImage

## Overview

You use instances of `NSImage` to load existing images, create new images, and draw the resulting image data into your views. Although you use this class predominantly for image-related operations, the class itself knows little about the underlying image data. Instead, it works in conjunction with one or more image representation objects (subclasses of `NSImageRep`) to manage and render the image data. For the most part, these interactions are transparent.

The class serves many purposes, providing support for the following tasks:

- Loading images stored on disk or at a specified URL.

- Drawing images into a view or graphics context.

- Providing the contents of a `CALayer` object.

- Creating new images based on a series of captured drawing commands.

- Producing versions of the image in a different format.

The `NSImage` class itself is capable of managing image data in a variety of formats. The specific list of formats is dependent on the version of the operating system but includes many standard formats such as TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, and PDF among others. AppKit manages each format using a specific type of image representation object, whose job is to manage the actual image data. You can get a list of supported formats using the methods described in Determining Supported Types of Images.

For more information about how to use image objects in your app, see Cocoa Drawing Guide.

### Using Images with Core Animation Layers

Although you can assign an `NSImage` object directly to the `contents` property of a `CALayer` object, doing so may not always yield the best results. Instead of using your image object, you can use the `layerContents(forContentsScale:)` method to obtain an object that you can use for your layer’s contents. The image created by that method serves as the contents of a layer, which also supports all of the layer’s gravity modes. By contrast, the `NSImage` class supports only the `resize`, `resizeAspect`, and `resizeAspectFill` modes.

Before calling the `layerContents(forContentsScale:)` method, use the `recommendedLayerContentsScale(_:)` method to get the recommended scale factor for the resulting image. The code listing below shows a typical example that uses the scale factor of a window’s backing store as the desired scale factor. From that scale factor, the code gets the scale factor for the specified image object and creates an object that you assign to the layer. You might use this code for images that fit the layer bounds precisely or for which you rely on the `contentsGravity` property of the layer to position or scale the image.

Listing 1. Assigning an image to a layer

static void updateLayerWithImageInWindow1(NSImage *image, CALayer *layer, NSWindow *window) {
CGFloat desiredScaleFactor = [window backingScaleFactor];
CGFloat actualScaleFactor = [image recommendedLayerContentsScale:desiredScaleFactor];

id layerContents = [image layerContentsForContentsScale:actualScaleFactor];

[layer setContents:layerContents];
[layer setContentsScale:actualScaleFactor];
}

## Overview

The `NSImageRep` class is called “semiabstract” because it has some instance variables and implementation of its own, in addition to defining subclasses. Although an `NSImageRep` subclass can be used directly, it is typically accessed through an `NSImage` object, which manages a group of image representations, choosing the best one for the current output device.

# NSBitmapImageRep

An object that renders an image from bitmap data.

macOS

class NSBitmapImageRep

## Overview

Supported bitmap data formats include GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, and various permutations of raw bitmap data.

### Alpha Premultiplication and Bitmap Formats

When creating a bitmap using a premultiplied format, if a coverage (alpha) plane exists, the bitmap’s color components are premultiplied with it. In this case, if you modify the contents of the bitmap, you are therefore responsible for premultiplying the data. Note that premultiplying generally has negligible effect on output quality. For floating-point image data, premultiplying color components is a lossless operation, but for fixed-point image data, premultiplication can introduce small rounding errors. In either case, more rounding errors may appear when compositing many premultiplied images; however, such errors are generally not readily visible.

For this reason, you should not use an `NSBitmapImageRep` object if you want to manipulate image data. To work with data that is not premultiplied, use the Core Graphics framework instead. (Specifically, create images using the `init(width:height:bitsPerComponent:bitsPerPixel:bytesPerRow:space:bitmapInfo:provider:decode:shouldInterpolate:intent:)` function and `CGImageAlphaInfo.last` parameter.) Alternatively, include the `NSAlphaNonpremultipliedBitmapFormat` flag when creating the bitmap.

Class

# NSGraphicsContext

An object that represents a graphics context.

macOS

class NSGraphicsContext

## Overview

You can think of a graphics context as a destination to which drawing and graphics state operations are sent for execution. Each graphics context contains its own graphics environment and state.

The `NSGraphicsContext` class is an abstract superclass for destination-specific graphics contexts. You obtain instances of concrete subclasses with the class methods `current`, `init(attributes:)`, `init(bitmapImageRep:)`, `init(cgContext:flipped:)`, and `init(window:)`.

At any time there is the notion of the current context. The current context for the current thread may be set using `current`.

Graphics contexts are maintained on a stack. You push a graphics context onto the stack by sending it a `saveGraphicsState()` message, and pop it off the stack by sending it a `restoreGraphicsState()` message. By sending `restoreGraphicsState()` to a graphics context object you remove it from the stack, and the next graphics context on the stack becomes the current graphics context.

## Topics

- NSBezierPath

Class

# NSBezierPath

An object that can create paths using PostScript-style commands.

macOS

class NSBezierPath

## Overview

Paths consist of straight and curved line segments joined together. Paths can form recognizable shapes such as rectangles, ovals, arcs, and glyphs; they can also form complex polygons using either straight or curved line segments. A single path can be closed by connecting its two endpoints, or it can be left open.

An `NSBezierPath` object can contain multiple disconnected paths, whether they are closed or open. Each of these paths is referred to as a subpath. The subpaths of a Bézier path object must be manipulated as a group. The only way to manipulate subpaths individually is to create separate `NSBezierPath` objects for each.

For a given `NSBezierPath` object, you can stroke the path’s outline or fill the region occupied by the path. You can also use the path as a clipping region for views or other regions. Using methods of `NSBezierPath`, you can also perform hit detection on the filled or stroked path. Hit detection is needed to implement interactive graphics, as in rubber banding and dragging operations.

The current graphics context is automatically saved and restored for all drawing operations involving Bézier path objects, so your application does not need to worry about the graphics settings changing across invocations.

Class

# NSGradient

An object that can draw gradient fill colors

class NSGradient

## Overview

This class provides convenience methods for drawing radial or linear (axial) gradients for rectangles and `NSBezierPath` objects. It also supports primitive methods that let you customize the shape of the gradient fill. A gradient consists of two or more color changes over the range of the gradient shape. When creating a gradient object, you specify the colors and their locations relative to the start and end of the gradient. This combination of color and location is known as a _color stop_. During drawing, the `NSGradient` object uses the color stop information to compute color changes for you and passes that information to the Quartz shading functions.

Because the `NSGradient` class uses Quartz shadings, drawing is handled by computing the colors at a given point mathematically. This technique results in smooth gradients regardless of the resolution of the target device.

For more information about gradients and their appearance, see Gradients in Quartz 2D Programming Guide.

## Mentioned in

Customizing Writing Tools behavior for AppKit views

Adopting the system text cursor in custom text views

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom AppKit view

## Overview

The `NSTextField` class uses the `NSTextFieldCell` class to implement its user interface. Text fields display text either as a static label or as an editable input field. The content of a text field is either plain text or a rich-text attributed string. Text fields also support line wrapping to display multiline text, and a variety of truncation styles if the content doesn’t fit the available space.

The parent class, `NSControl`, provides the methods for setting the values of the text field, such as `stringValue` and `doubleValue`. There are corresponding methods to retrieve values.

In macOS 12 and later, if you explicitly call the `layoutManager` property on your text field, the framework will revert to a compatibility mode that uses `NSLayoutManager`. The text view also switches to this compatibility mode when it encounters text content that’s not yet supported.

The `NSScrollView` class is the central coordinator for AppKit’s scrolling machinery, which is composed of this class, and the `NSClipView` and `NSScroller` classes.

When using an `NSClipView` object within a scroll view (the usual configuration), you should issue messages that control background drawing state to the scroll view directly, rather than messaging the clip view.

# NSIgnoreMisspelledWords

A protocol that enables the Ignore button in the Spelling panel to function properly.

macOS

protocol NSIgnoreMisspelledWords

## Overview

The Ignore button allows the user to accept a word that the spelling checker believes is misspelled. In order for this action to update the “ignored words” list for the document being checked, the `NSIgnoreMisspelledWords` protocol must be implemented.

This protocol is necessary because a list of ignored words is useful only if it pertains to the entire document being checked, but the spelling checker (that is, an `NSSpellChecker` object) does not check the entire document for spelling at once. The spelling checker returns as soon as it finds a misspelled word. Thus, it checks only a subset of the document at any one time. The user usually wants to check the entire document, so usually several spelling checks are run in succession until no misspelled words are found. This protocol allows the list of ignored words to be maintained per document, even though the spelling checks are not run per document.

The `NSIgnoreMisspelledWords` protocol specifies a method, `ignoreSpelling(_:)`, which should be implemented like this:

- (void)ignoreSpelling:(id)sender {
[[NSSpellChecker sharedSpellChecker] ignoreWord:[[sender selectedCell] stringValue]\
inSpellDocumentWithTag: myDocumentTag];
}

The second argument to the `NSSpellChecker` method `ignoreWord(_:inSpellDocumentWithTag:)` is a tag that the spell checker can use to distinguish the documents being checked. When the spell checker can distinguish the various documents, it can append new ignored words to the appropriate list.

To make the ignored words feature useful, the application must store a document’s ignored words list with the document. See the `NSSpellChecker` class description for more information.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSText

## Overview

`NSText` draws text for user interface objects, provides text editing capabilities, and controls text attributes such as type size, font, and color.

`NSText` initialization creates an instance of a concrete subclass, such as `NSTextView` (generically called a text object). In general, you’re more likely to use the `NSTextView` subclass, because it extends the interface declared by `NSText` and provides much more sophisticated functionality than that declared in `NSText`.

AppKit uses text objects wherever text appears in interface objects. For example, a text object draws the title of a window, the commands in a menu, the title of a button, and the items in a browser. Your app can also create text objects for its own purposes.

# Adopting the system text cursor in custom text views

Incorporate the system text cursor into your custom text UI in AppKit.

## Overview

People can enter text into your app in a variety of ways, such as typing, copy and paste, or dictation. macOS 14 introduces enhancements to the system UI for the text cursor to provide a more seamless text experience.

If your app handles text input through standard AppKit views such as `NSTextView` or `NSTextField`, your app automatically uses the system UI for the text cursor. This system UI includes the following elements:

- The text cursor that indicates the insertion point of the text

- Text cursor accessories that indicate state, such as current input source language, dictation, and Caps Lock

- Animation effects that surround the text cursor during dictation

If you have a highly customized UI for displaying text, you can adopt this system UI in your AppKit app.

### Add the system text cursor to a custom text view

If your app handles text input through a custom view that builds on `NSTextInputClient`, you can display the system text cursor manually. Create an `NSTextInsertionIndicator` view and add it on top of the view that displays text in your app.

// Set up the text cursor.
let textCursor = NSTextInsertionIndicator(frame: .zero)
documentView.addSubview(textCursor)

When your custom text view becomes active or becomes first responder, update the display mode of the text cursor.

// Show the text cursor when the text view becomes active.
func didBecomeActive() {
textCursor.displayMode = .automatic
}

### Configure the text cursor animations

Depending on the behavior you need at a particular point in time, you can determine how the text cursor handles animations by selecting one of these display modes:

- Automatic. Set the `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode.automatic` display mode to stop and start animations for the text cursor automatically. These animations include a blinking effect that applies to the text cursor during typing and dictation, animated transitions between dictation states, and automatic hiding of the text cursor during tracking loops. This display mode is appropriate in the majority of cases when your custom text view is accepting text input.

- Always visible. Set the `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode.visible` display mode to always show the text cursor and disable animations. This display mode is appropriate when the text cursor needs to appear without blinking — for example, to indicate a drop destination as part of a drag and drop interaction.

When you use the automatic display mode, you can further customize the animation options depending on the needs of your app.

- By default, the text cursor hides automatically during tracking loops. Include the `showWhileTracking` option in `automaticModeOptions` to show the text cursor during tracking instead.

- By default, the text cursor shows an animated effect during dictation. To completely hide the view that draws the animated effect, remove `showEffectsView` from `automaticModeOptions`. To customize the placement of this view in your view hierarchy, specify `effectsViewInserter`.

The following code shows how to customize the placement of the animated effects view to place it directly below the text cursor.

// Specify custom view hierarchy placement for the animated effects view.
textCursor.effectsViewInserter = { view in
documentView.addSubview(view, positioned: .below, relativeTo: textCursor)
}

### Update the text cursor position

Your custom text view is responsible for updating the position of the text cursor when a person inputs text, but the system provides the appropriate animated effect. For example, the following image shows the system animation effect that applies to the text cursor during dictation.

As a person types or inserts text during dictation, update the `frame` of the `NSTextInsertionIndicator` view. The view automatically changes its appearance in response to that movement, matching the system UI for the corresponding type of input (typing or dictation).

### Configure the placements of text cursor accessories

The system text cursor displays accessories that indicate state, such as current input source language, dictation, and Caps Lock. For example, the following image shows the text cursor with the dictation indicator and the current input language set to English.

When a person changes the input language, the accessory expands to show the language selection UI in the language switcher accessory.

`NSTextInsertionIndicator` draws these accessories automatically, but you can specify where in relation to the text cursor to draw them. In your custom text view, you can override the placement of these accessories by specifying `preferredTextAccessoryPlacement()` in your implementation of `NSTextInputClient`. When the system renders the text cursor in your custom view, it uses the return value of this method to determine where to draw the accessories.

### Indicate the offscreen text cursor position during dictation

The system text cursor shows a dictation indicator accessory during an active dictation session. When a person scrolls the text cursor offscreen during dictation, the system also draws a scroll-away indicator to indicate the position of the cursor. For example, the following image shows a scroll-away indicator that points downwards, indicating that the text cursor is out of view below.

For the system to show the scroll-away indicator on a custom text view, you need to complete the following steps:

- Adopt `NSTextInputClient` and implement `unionRectInVisibleSelectedRange` and `documentVisibleRect`. These properties provide the system with the coordinate information it needs to draw the scroll-away indicator in the appropriate position.

- Notify the system when a person starts or stops scrolling, so the system can display the indicator at the appropriate time. Call `textInputClientWillStartScrollingOrZooming()` when scrolling starts, and `textInputClientDidEndScrollingOrZooming()` when scrolling ends.

### Hide the system text cursor

When your custom text view resigns first responder status, update the display mode of the text cursor to `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode.hidden`.

// Hide the text cursor when the text view becomes inactive.
func didBecomeInactive() {
textCursor.displayMode = .hidden
}

## Mentioned in

Adopting the system text cursor in custom text views

## Overview

`NSTextView` and `NSTextField` both use `NSTextInsertionIndicator` to display the insertion indicator. You can use this indicator if you have your own text engine or need to display an indicator elsewhere.

To use the indicator, instantiate an `NSTextInsertionIndicator`, then add the view to your view hierarchy. Set the indicator view’s frame to where you want to display a text insertion indicator. The indicator has the same height as the indicator view’s frame, and centers horizontally within the indicator view’s frame.

The `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode` specifies whether the indicator hides, remains visible, or blinks (automatic).

When set to `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode.automatic`, the indicator stops blinking when you set the frame. The indicator starts blinking when the frame doesn’t change for a period of time. When the user dictates, the indicator displays a trailing glow when it is moved.

Set the `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode` to `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode.automatic` when your custom view becomes the first responder. When your custom view resigns first responder, set the `displayMode` to `NSTextInsertionIndicator.DisplayMode.hidden` to indicate that key events aren’t sent to your view.

By default the indicator’s color is `textInsertionPointColor`. You can set a different color.

## Topics

### Configuring indicators

`var color: NSColor!`

An optional closure the system calls during dictation.

Class

# NSFont

The representation of a font in an app.

macOS

class NSFont

## Overview

`NSFont` objects represent fonts to an app, providing access to characteristics of the font and assistance in laying out glyphs relative to one another. Font objects are also used to establish the current font for drawing text directly into a graphics context, using the `set()` method.

You don’t create `NSFont` objects using the `alloc` and `init` methods. Instead, you use either `init(descriptor:size:)` or `init(name:size:)` to look up an available font and alter its size or matrix to your needs. These methods check for an existing font object with the specified characteristics, returning it if there is one. Otherwise, they look up the font data requested and create the appropriate object. `NSFont` also defines a number of methods for getting standard system fonts, such as `systemFont(ofSize:)`, `userFont(ofSize:)`, and `messageFont(ofSize:)`. To request the default size for these standard fonts, pass a negative number or `0` as the font size. See macOS Human Interface Guidelines for more information about system fonts.

Class

# NSFontManager

The center of activity for the font-conversion system.

macOS

class NSFontManager

## Overview

The font manager records the currently selected font, updates the Font panel and Font menu to reflect the selected font, initiates font changes, and converts fonts in response to requests from text-bearing objects. In a more prosaic role, `NSFontManager` can be queried for the fonts available to the application and for the particular attributes of a font, such as whether it’s condensed or extended.

You typically set up a font manager and the Font menu using Interface Builder. However, you can also do so programmatically by getting the shared font manager instance and having it create the standard Font menu at runtime:

NSFontManager *fontManager = [NSFontManager sharedFontManager];
NSMenu *fontMenu = [fontManager fontMenu:YES];

You can then add the Font menu to your app’s main menu. After the Font menu is installed, your app automatically gains the functionality of both the Font menu and the Font panel.

Font collections are managed by `NSFontManager`.

Class

# NSFontDescriptor

A dictionary of attributes that describe a font.

macOS

class NSFontDescriptor

## Overview

A font descriptor can be used to create or modify an `NSFont` object. The system provides a font matching capability, so that you can partially describe a font by creating a font descriptor with, for example, just a family name. You can then find all the available fonts on the system with a matching family name using `matchingFontDescriptors(withMandatoryKeys:)`.

There are several ways to create a new `NSFontDescriptor` object. You can use `alloc` and `init(fontAttributes:)`, `fontDescriptorWithFontAttributes:`, `init(name:matrix:)`, or `init(name:size:)`. to create a font descriptor based on either your custom attributes dictionary or on a specific font’s name and size. Alternatively you can use one of the `fontDescriptor…` instance methods (such as `withFace(_:)`) to create a modified version of an existing descriptor. The latter methods are useful if you have an existing descriptor and simply want to change one aspect.

All attributes in the attributes dictionary are optional.

## Discussion

The upper 16 bits is used to describe appearance of the font (see `NSFontFamilyClass`) whereas the lower 16 bits is used for typeface information (see Typeface Information). The font appearance information represented by the upper 16 bits can be used for stylistic font matching. The symbolic traits supersede the existing `NSFontTraitMask` type used by `NSFontManager`. The corresponding values are kept compatible between `NSFontTraitMask` and `NSFontSymbolicTraits`.

# NSFontCollection

A font collection, which is a group of font descriptors taken together as a single object.

class NSFontCollection

## Overview

You can publicize the font collection as a named collection and it is presented through the System user interface such as the font panel and Font Book. The queries can be modified using the `NSMutableFontCollection` subclass.

## Topics

Class

# NSPrintPanel

The Print panel that queries the user for information about a print job.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSPrintPanel

## Overview

A Print panel may let the user select the range of pages to print and the number of copies before executing the Print command. Print panels can display a simplified interface when printing certain types of data. For example, the panel can display a list of print-setting presets, which lets the user enable print settings in groups as opposed to individually. Assigning an appropriate string to the `jobStyleHint` property activates the simplified interface and identifies which presets to display.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

# NSPrinter

An object that describes a printer’s capabilities.

macOS

class NSPrinter

## Overview

`NSPrinter` provides information about a printer; it does not modify printer attributes or control a printing job. A printer object can be constructed by specifying either the printer name or the make and model of an available printer. Typically, Cocoa apps don’t create `NSPrinter` objects; instead, the printing system uses these objects to support the printing jobs and when it shows users a list of printers.

## Topics

Class

# NSPrintInfo

An object that stores information that’s used to generate printed output.

macOS

class NSPrintInfo

## Overview

A shared `NSPrintInfo` object is automatically created for an app and is used by default for all printing jobs for that app. The printing information in an `NSPrintInfo` object is stored in a dictionary. To access the standard attributes in the dictionary directly, this class defines a set of keys and provides the `dictionary()` method. You can also initialize an instance of this class using the `init(dictionary:)` method.

You can use this dictionary to store custom information associated with a print job. Any non-object values should be stored as `NSNumber` or `NSValue` objects in the dictionary. See `NSNumber` for a list of types which should be stored as numbers. For other non-object values, use the `NSValue` class.

To store custom information that belongs in printing presets you should use the dictionary returned by the `printSettings` method.

# NSPrintOperation

An object that controls operations that generate Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) code, Portable Document Format (PDF) code, or print jobs.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSPrintOperation

## Overview

An `NSPrintOperation` object works in conjunction with two other objects: an `NSPrintInfo` object, which specifies how the code should be generated, and an `NSView` object, which generates the actual code.

It is important to note that the majority of methods in `NSPrintOperation` copy the instance of `NSPrintInfo` passed into them. Future changes to that print info are not reflected in the print info retained by the current `NSPrintOperation` object. All changes should be made to the print info before passing to the methods of this class. The only method in `NSPrintOperation` which does not copy the `NSPrintInfo` instance is `printInfo`.

Class

# NSColor

An object that stores color data and sometimes opacity (alpha value).

macOS

class NSColor

## Overview

Many methods in AppKit require you to specify color data using an `NSColor` object; when drawing you use them to set the current fill and stroke colors. Color objects are immutable and thread-safe. You can create color objects in many ways:

- Load colors from an asset catalog. Colors created from assets can adapt automatically to system appearance changes.

- Use the semantic colors for custom UI elements, so that they match the appearance of other AppKit views; see UI Element Colors.

- Use the adaptable system colors, such as `systemBlue`, when you want a specific tint that looks correct in both light and dark environments.

- Create a color object from another object, such as a Core Graphics representation of a color, or a Core Image color.

- Create a color from an `NSImage` object, and paint a repeating pattern instead of using a solid color.

- Create a color by applying a transform to another `NSColor` object. For example, you might perform a blend operation between two colors, or you might create a color that represents the same color, but in a different color space.

- Create custom colors using raw component values, and a variety of color spaces, when you need to represent user-specified colors.

For user-specified colors, you can also display a color panel and let the user specify the color. For information about color panels, see `NSColorPanel`.

### Color and Color Spaces

A color object is typically represented internally as a Core Graphics color ( `CGColor`) in a Core Graphics color space ( `CGColorSpace`). Colors can also be created in extended color spaces:

- `extendedSRGB`

- `extendedGenericGamma22Gray`

When you need to worry about color spaces, use extended color spaces as working color spaces. When you need to worry about representing that color as closely as possible in a specific color space, convert the color from the extended color space into the target color space.

When working in an extended color space, color values are not clamped to fit inside the color gamut, meaning that component values may be less than `0.0` or greater than `1.0`. When displayed on an sRGB display, such colors are outside the gamut and won’t render accurately. However, extended color spaces are useful as working color spaces when you want a pixel format and representation that other color spaces can be easily converted into. For example, a color in the Display P3 color space can convert to an extended sRGB format, even if it isn’t within the sRGB color gamut. While some of the converted color’s values are outside of the 0-1.0 range, the color renders correctly when viewed on a device with a P3 display gamut.

It is a programmer error to access color components of a color space that the `NSColor` object does not support. For example, you cannot access the `redComponent` property and `getRed(_:green:blue:alpha:)` method on a color that uses the CMYK color space. Further, the `getComponents(_:)` method and `numberOfComponents` property work only in color spaces that have individual components. As such, they return the components of color objects as individual floating-point values regardless of whether they’re based on `NSColorSpace` objects or named color spaces. However, older component-fetching methods such as `getRed(_:green:blue:alpha:)` are effective only on color objects based on named color spaces.

If you have a color object in an unknown color space and you want to extract its components, convert the color object to a known color space and then use the component accessor methods of that color space.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

## Topics

### Getting and Creating Colors

Get one of the AppKit-defined colors, load colors from asset catalogs, or create custom colors for your app.

Retrieve standard color objects for use with windows, controls, labels, text, selections and other content in your app.

Retrieve the standard color objects for common colors like red, blue, green, black, white, and more.

Load colors from asset catalogs, and create colors from raw component values, such as those used by grayscale, RGB, HSB, and CMYK colors.

### Applying Specific Appearances to Colors

Returns a new color object that represents the current color modified to include the specified visual effect.

`enum SystemEffect`

Constants for user interactions that change the appearance of a view or control.

### Transforming Existing Color Objects

Creates a new color object representing the color of the current color object in the specified color space.

# Customizing Writing Tools behavior for AppKit views

Modify the behavior of Writing Tools in standard macOS text views, and adjust your app’s behavior while the feature is active.

## Overview

The `NSTextView` and `NSTextField` classes have built-in support for Writing Tools, but you can customize how the feature works for your interface. You might choose to change how someone experiences Writing Tools in your app, or disable the feature for specific types of content. For example, you might disable Writing Tools in a view that you use to display code listings. You can also customize the type of content Writing Tools generates for your text view.

### Specifying the Writing Tools UI experience you want

Writing Tools supports both limited and complete versions of the Writing Tools experience. The limited experience keeps changes in the Writing Tools interface until the person approves them. The limited experience displays the changes inline with the rest of your view’s content. Both experiences give people the ability to accept or reject changes, but the complete experience offers a more interactive way to view those changes.

To specify the experience you want, change the value in your view’s `writingToolsBehavior` property. The system applies the best available experience to views by default, but you can specify the experience you prefer in your views. You can also disable the feature if you don’t want Writing Tools to be active in your view. To disable the feature, set the value of this property to `NSWritingToolsBehavior.none`.

### Modify your app’s behavior when Writing Tools is active

It takes time for the large language models (LLMs) of Writing Tools to suggest changes. It also takes time for someone to review the changes and approve them. While those things happen, Writing Tools might make temporary changes to your view’s content. During that time, disable any app-specific features that might interfere with the Writing Tools operation. For example, you might choose to disable cloud-based updates of your text while Writing Tools is active.

In a `NSTextView` you can determine when Writing Tools is active using your delegate object. The system calls the delegate’s `textViewWritingToolsWillBegin(_:)` method before Writing Tools makes any modifications, and it calls the `textViewWritingToolsDidEnd(_:)` method after incorporating any final changes. Use those methods to turn off any features that might interfere with Writing Tools while it’s active.

### Specify ranges of text for Writing Tools to ignore

If you don’t want Writing Tools to modify portions of your `NSTextView` object, implement the `textView(_:writingToolsIgnoredRangesInEnclosingRange:)` method in your delegate. Writing Tools calls that method for each operation, providing you with the range of text it’s considering. Use your implementation of the method to specify any subranges of text you want Writing Tools to ignore. You might use this method to prevent Writing Tools from changing code listings, proper names, or direct quotes embedded in the text.

# Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

Adopt a simplified version of the Writing Tools experience in a custom view using the pasteboard and macOS services.

## Overview

Writing Tools works automatically with `NSTextView` in AppKit, but you can also use it with any custom subclass of `NSView` that has text. To use Writing Tools with a custom view, you have to write some additional code to transfer text between your view and the Writing Tools feature. You also have to provide a contextual menu for your view, which AppKit modifies to allow people to launch the Writing Tools UI.

You can add Writing Tools support to both read-only and editable views. When your view is read-only, Writing Tools leaves the updated text on the pasteboard instead of incorporating it back into your view. For editable views, your code replaces the view’s current text selection with the rewritten content that Writing Tools provides.

### Add a contextual menu to your custom view

People launch the Writing Tools UI through interactions with your view’s contextual menu. If your view doesn’t currently have a contextual menu, add one and populate it with app-specific commands. For example, you might add commands to cut, copy, or paste text. When you display the menu, the system automatically adds Writing Tools–specific commands to it, based on the level of support your app provides.

Construct a contextual menu for your view and save it in the view’s menu property. When this property contains a menu, `NSView` displays it as a contextual menu automatically when appropriate events occur. For example, the view displays it in response to a right mouse-down event. The following code shows you how to create a menu, add some menu items to it, and save it to the view’s menu property:

self.menu = NSMenu()
self.menu?.addItem(NSMenuItem(title: "Cut",
action: #selector(cut(_:)),
keyEquivalent: ""))
self.menu?.addItem(NSMenuItem(title: "Copy",
action: #selector(copy(_:)),
keyEquivalent: ""))
self.menu?.addItem(NSMenuItem(title: "Paste",
action: #selector(paste(_:)),
keyEquivalent: “"))

If you want to customize your view’s contextual menu before you display it, implement the `menu(for:)` method to return the menu you want for appropriate events. You can also display a contextual menu programmatically using the menu’s `popUpContextMenu(_:with:for:)` method.

### Provide a requester object to coordinate interactions

The AppKit support for Writing Tools in custom views relies on the same infrastructure that apps use to offer services from the Services menu. Before displaying your view’s contextual menu, AppKit calls the view’s `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method to determine if your view supports specific types of text data. If you do, you return an `NSServicesMenuRequestor` object from that method to enable the Writing Tools feature for your view. AppKit then automatically adds commands to your view’s contextual menu to let someone launch the feature’s UI.

When determining whether your view supports Writing Tools, AppKit calls your view’s `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method multiple times with different pasteboard types. Writing Tools can work with rich text or plain text content, and AppKit asks for a requestor object for the `rtf` pasteboard type first. If you don’t provide an object for that type, AppKit asks for a requestor object for the `string` pasteboard type. If your view is editable, return a requestor object when both method parameters contain the supported pasteboard type. For a read-only view, return a requestor object when the `sendType` parameter contains the supported type and the `returnType` parameter is `nil`.

The following code shows an implementation of the `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method in a read-only view that displays a plain text string. Because the view is read-only, the implementation returns the view object only when the `returnType` parameter is `nil`. If you don’t perform that check, AppKit assumes your view is editable and tries to integrate the rewritten text back into your view.

override func validRequestor(forSendType
sendType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType?,

if sendType == .string && returnType == nil {
return self
}
return super.validRequestor(forSendType: sendType,
returnType: returnType)
}

AppKit uses your requestor object to fetch your view’s selected text, and to deliver the rewritten text protocol in the object you use to manage the text selection for your view. You can adopt this protocol in your view, or in a separate object you use to manage the backing store for that view.

### Write your view’s selected text to the pasteboard

The requestor object you provide to AppKit is responsible for writing your custom view’s text selection to the pasteboard. When someone engages a Writing Tools feature for your view, AppKit calls your requestor object’s `writeSelection(to:types:)` method to get the current text. Write text to the pasteboard in the format that your view’s `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` method indicates you support. For example, if you provided a requestor object for the `rtf` type, write data to the pasteboard in the RTF format. You don’t need to write multiple data formats to the pasteboard to ensure interoperability with other apps. For Writing Tools operations, AppKit provides you with a dedicated pasteboard that’s private to the operation.

For plain text, write the text directly to the pasteboard using `setString(_:forType:)` method of `NSPasteboard`. For rich text, make sure your view manages its content using an attributed string. You can generate a `Data` object in the RTF format directly from the contents of an `NSAttributedString` object. If you store your view’s text using a Swift `AttributedString` type instead, create an `NSAttributedString` from your Swift string first. Set the data on the pasteboard and return true to pass the data along to the Writing Tools system, as shown in the following example:

func writeSelection(to pboard: NSPasteboard,

pboard.setString(text, forType: .string)
return true
}

### Read updated text from the pasteboard

If your view contains editable text, implement the `readSelection(from:)` method in your requestor object to integrate any rewritten content back into your view. AppKit calls the `readSelection(from:)` method after the person accepts any Writing Tools changes. In your implementation, read the updated text from the provided pasteboard and replace your view’s current text selection with the new text.

If your view conforms to the `NSTextInputClient` protocol, Writing Tools calls your view’s `insertText(_:replacementRange:)` method first to handle text insertions and replacments. If you implement that method, insert the provided text, replacing any previous text as needed. If you don’t implement that method in your view, Writing Tools calls the `readSelection(from:)` method instead.

### Customize the anchor placement for the Writing Tools popover

When AppKit displays the Writing Tools UI, it anchors the popover to your entire view. To change the anchor point, you need to supply a new anchor point for your view. For example, you might want to anchor the Writing Tools UI to the rectangle that contains the current text selection instead.

To anchor the Writing Tools UI to a custom part of your view’s content, adopt the `NSViewContentSelectionInfo` protocol in your view and set the `selectionAnchorRect` property to a rectangle in your view’s coordinate space. For example, for an editable view with an active text selection, set it to the rectangle of the selected text. AppKit places the Writing Tools popover relative to the custom rectangle you provide.

# Adding Writing Tools support to a custom AppKit view

Integrate Writing Tools support, including support for inline replacement animations, to your custom text views on macOS.

## Overview

Even if you don’t use a `NSTextView` or `NSTextField` object in your app, you can still add Writing Tools support to other views that contain text. You might use this support when you prefer not to use the standard text views. For example, you might use it if you build your own text view using TextKit or your own proprietary text engine. The AppKit API for this support gives you access to the same Writing Tools features available in the system views, including the ability to animate changes to the text in your view.

When a person triggers the Writing Tools UI from your custom view, AppKit works with your view to evaluate the relevant text and incorporate changes. You specify the type of Writing Tools experience you want for your view. The complete experience animates changes to your view’s content directly, working with your view to create those animations. The limited experience displays changes in the Writing Tools UI, and only incorporates the final changes back into your view’s text storage. All of these interactions happen with the help of the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` object you assign to your view.

### Add a Writing Tools coordinator to your view

An `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` object manages interactions between your view and the Writing Tools feature. You attach this object to your view by assigning it to the `writingToolsCoordinator` property of `NSView`. To manage your view-specific behavior, you provide a delegate object when setting up the coordinator. Your delegate provides Writing Tools with initial text to evaluate, incorporates changes, provides proofreading marks, and provides preview objects to use during animations.

Attach a coordinator object to your view, typically when creating and configuring that view. Supply a delegate object that adopts the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` protocol and has access to your view’s text content and layout information. The following example shows an extension to a custom view that creates the coordinator and initializes it with the view itself. The custom method checks to see if Writing Tools is available before creating a coordinator object and adding it to the view.

class MyTextView : NSView {
var coordinator: NSWritingToolsCoordinator?

//…
}

extension MyTextView : NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate {

func configureWritingTools() {
guard NSWritingToolsCoordinator.isWritingToolsAvailable else { return }
guard coordinator == nil else { return }

let coordinator = NSWritingToolsCoordinator(delegate:self)
writingToolsCoordinator = coordinator
}
//…
}

The presence of a coordinator object on your view causes AppKit to enable Writing Tools support for that view. When someone interacts with your view’s contextual menu, AppKit automatically adds a command to that menu to launch Writing Tools. Similarly, the text-input system displays a visual affordance in response to relevant interactions with your view’s text.

For a complete list of delegate methods you must implement to support Writing Tools, see `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate`.

### Configure your view’s Writing Tools behavior

When setting up Writing Tools for your view, configure your coordinator’s `preferredBehavior` property with the types of interactions you support. Writing Tools offers different levels of integration with your view’s content, which also affects how much work you need to do to support the feature. With the complete experience, you provide AppKit with more information so that it can make changes directly in your view. The limited experience pushes more interactions into the Writing Tools UI, giving you a less integrated experience, but one that’s easier to implement.

At configuration time, you also specify the types of text content your view supports using your coordinator’s `preferredResultOptions` property. The models that Writing Tools uses to evaluate your text can generate plain or formatted text. Writing Tools supports all types of output by default, but you can limit it to specific types as needed.

The following code updates the previous example method, and adds some preferred behaviors for the coordinator object. In addition to wanting the inline experience for Writing Tools interactions, the method requests that the system generate rich text and optional list-based content. Providing a specific list of result options tells Writing Tools to generate only that type of content. You might provide this information if your view doesn’t support specific types of content, like tables.

let coordinator = NSWritingToolsCoordinator(delegate:self)
coordinator.preferredBehavior = .complete
coordinator.preferredResultOptions = [.richText, .list]
writingToolsCoordinator = coordinator
}

The availability of Writing Tools depends on the current device, its operating system, and its readiness to execute requests. On devices with appropriate hardware, some Writing Tools features operate locally after the system downloads the required models. However, more complex requests require a network connection so the system can use Private Cloud Compute to evaluate the provided text.

### Supply your view’s text for evaluation

When someone starts Writing Tools in your view, the system asks your delegate to provide the text to evaluate. Depending on what the person wants to do, Writing Tools might ask for only the selected text or it might ask for all of your view’s text. For example, they might want to proof only the currently selected text, or they might want to proofread all of the text in your view. You provide that text from your delegate inside a context object.

A `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context` object is a data object that you fill with the requested text. Context objects provide the common ground that you and Writing Tools use to communicate throughout a single operation. For each request, you create one context object for each text-storage object that has text for Writing Tools to consider. Most views have only one text-storage object and therefore create only one context object. However, a view that uses multiple subviews to manage different parts of its content might assign separate text-storage objects to each subview. In that scenario, you create one context object for each subview that contains the requested text.

To request your view’s context object, the coordinator calls your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsContextsFor:completion:)` method. Use the parameters of that method to determine if Writing Tools wants all of your view’s text or only some of it. The following example creates a single context object with either the currently selected text or the view’s full text. After creating the context, the custom `storeContexts` method saves a reference to the context for subsequent tasks.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: NSWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsContextsFor scope: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.ContextScope,

// Store the created contexts for the completion handler.
var contexts = NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context

switch scope {
case .userSelection:
let context = getContextObjectForSelection()
contexts.append(context)
break

case .fullDocument:
let context = getContextObjectForFullDocument()
contexts.append(context)
break

case .visibleArea:
let context = getContextObjectForVisibleArea()
contexts.append(context)
break

default:
break
}

// Save references to the contexts for later delegate calls.
storeContexts(contexts)

// Deliver the contexts to Writing Tools.
completion(contexts)
}

When specifying only a subset of your view’s text, provide some of the surrounding text to give Writing Tools additional content for its evaluation. As a general principle, include whole paragraphs of text in the context object, not just the currently selected text. Use the context object’s range value to identify the portion of the overall text that Writing Tools requested. For example, if you fill a context object with the current text selection and some of the surrounding text, use the context object’s `range` property to specify the location of the selected text in that object.

After you create a context object, cache any additional information that you need to map the text in your context object to the text in your view’s text storage. You need to know where the content for each context object starts, in order to update your text storage later. One option is to create a dictionary that maps the context object’s identifier to the starting location of its text in your text storage. You can use that value to adjust any context-specific ranges that Writing provides you later.

The following example shows a method that the delegate uses to create a context object for the current text selection. The method calls the custom `getSelectedTextToEvaluate` function, which returns an expanded version of the text that includes both the selection and some of the surrounding text. The method also returns the starting location of that expanded text in the view’s text storage. Because the text selection is now in the middle of the text, the method initializes the context object with a range that provides the location of only the selected text, relative to the start of `textToEvaluate`. The method saves the actual starting location in a dictionary variable, mapping the value to the context’s unique identifier.

var startingLocationsForContexts = UUID : Int

// Get the text to evaluate, which includes the text selection and some
// of the surrounding text. The method returns (NSAttributedString, Int),
// which represents the text itself, and the starting location of that
// text in the view's text storage.
let (textToEvaluate, startLocation) = getSelectedTextToEvaluate()

// Get the NSRange for the text selection, relative to the text storage.
let textSelectionRange = getTextSelectionRange()
var contextRange = textSelectionRange

// The view guarantees that startLocation is less than or equal to the
// selection range. Adjust contextRange so that location 0 corresponds
// to the first character in textToEvaluate. Keep the length the same.
contextRange.location = textSelectionRange.location - startLocation

// Create the new context object.
let context = NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context(attributedString: textToEvaluate,
range: contextRange)

// Save the starting location of the text, relative to the text storage.
startingLocationsForContexts[context.identifier] = startLocation

return context
}

After you create a context object, you can use its unique identifier as a key for saving other data. The context objects you create remain in existence for the duration of the current Writing Tools operation. If the person rejects the current changes and starts a new operation, Writing Tools asks you for a new set of context objects.

### Incorporate changes back into your text storage

After evaluating your view’s text, Writing Tools delivers any suggested changes to your delegate object. If your view adopts the limited experience, Writing Tools waits until the person accepts any changes before delivering them to your view. If you adopt the complete experience, Writing Tools delivers the changes before the person accepts them. If the person later rejects the changes, Writing Tools delivers a new set of changes that restore your view’s original text.

In your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replace:in:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` method, incorporate the specified change into your view’s text storage. Writing Tools calls this method for each distinct change it needs to make, and it might call the method multiple times with different range values for the same context object. The following simple example validates the provided range information and validates the view’s own cached information for the context object. If everything is valid, the method then calculates the correct range of text to replace and creates a transaction to perform the replacement. Before returning, the method executes the provided completion handler with the text it incorporated, if any.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: NSWritingToolsCoordinator,
replace range: NSRange,
in context: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,
proposedText replacementText: NSAttributedString,
reason: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.TextReplacementReason,
animationParameters: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.AnimationParameters?,

// Make sure there's a valid starting location in the text storage.
guard let startingLocation = startingLocationsForContexts[context.identifier]
else { completion(nil); return }
guard let textStorage = textContentStorage.textStorage else { completion(nil); return }

// Determine the correct location in the text storage.
let adjustedRange = NSRange(location: startingLocation + range.location, length: range.length)

// Update the text storage using a transaction.
textContentStorage.performEditingTransaction {
textStorage.replaceCharacters(in: adjustedRange, with: replacementText)
}

completion(replacementText)
}

After each replacement operation, update other parts of your app as needed to account for the change. An `NSTextContentManager` object automatically generates the required layout updates when you make changes using a transaction. If you need to update other parts of your interface, initiate those changes from your `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replace:in:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` method. For example, you might update a view that displays the current character count for your document. Check the `reason` parameter to determine when Writing Tools is making changes interactively, and use the provided animation parameters object to create the actual animations.

### Update your view’s selected text

When working on your view’s selected text, Writing Tools updates the text selection to account for any text updates. Use your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:select:in:completion:)` method to update the selected text in your view. The method delivers an array of range values to allow for views to create discontiguous selections. If your view supports only a continuous range of selected characters, update your view’s selection based on the first element in the `ranges` array.

When implementing your delegate method, remember to update range values to account for offset to the start of the text in your context object. The following example creates an adjusted set of ranges by adding the starting location recorded at the start of the operation for the context object. It then passes that information to the view’s text engine to highlight the appropriate ranges of text.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: NSWritingToolsCoordinator,
select ranges: [NSValue],
in context: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

guard let startingLocation = startingLocationsForContexts[context.identifier]
else { completion(); return }
var adjustedRanges = NSRange

for value in ranges {
let range = value.rangeValue
let newRange = NSRange(location: startingLocation + range.location, length: range.length)
adjustedRanges.append(newRange)
}

// Highlight the specified text in the view.
selectTextInDocument(adjustedRanges)
completion()
}

### Generate preview images for inline animated changes

When you choose the complete Writing Tools experience for your view, the system animates changes to your content directly in your view. The system creates animations when Writing Tools starts evaluating your text, when it removes old text, and when it inserts new text. Because the animations involve your content, you must help the system create them. At appropriate times, the coordinator asks your delegate object to perform the following tasks:

1. Create a preview image of a specific portion of your content.

2. Hide that content when the animation starts.

3. Show the content again when the animation finishes.

To create a preview image of your text, configure a graphics context for bitmap-based drawing in your your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsPreviewFor:of:in:completion:)` method. Get the frame rectangle for the specified range of text using your layout manager, and use your graphics context to draw the text in that rectangle and generate an image.

The following example shows an implementation of the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsPreviewFor:of:in:completion:)` method that creates a preview for the view’s text. The method relies on the view’s layout manager to get the text rectangles that surround each line of text in the specified range. It also uses the layout manager to draw the text using the provided graphics context. The method then uses that context to generate an image of the rendered text and create a `NSTextPreview` object with the required information. When creating animations, Writing Tools applies the required visual effects to the provided preview image instead of to the text itself.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: NSWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsPreviewFor textAnimation: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.TextAnimation,
of range: NSRange,
in context: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

let textRange = MyTextRange(range) // Create the view's custom subclass of NSTextRange.

var previews = NSTextPreview

if !textRange.isEmpty {
// Get the frame rectangle that encloses the text.
let textFrame = unionRect(for: textRects.map({$0.rectValue}))

// Configure a graphics context for drawing in the specified rectangle.
let scaleFactor = self.window!.backingScaleFactor
let bitsPerComponent = 8
let numberOfComponents = 4
let pixelWidth = Int(textFrame.size.width * scaleFactor)
let pixelHeight = Int(textFrame.size.height * scaleFactor)
let bytesPerRow = pixelWidth * numberOfComponents
let bitmapInfo = CGImageAlphaInfo.premultipliedLast.rawValue
let colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB()

if let context = CGContext(data: nil, width: pixelWidth, height: pixelHeight,
bitsPerComponent: bitsPerComponent, bytesPerRow: bytesPerRow,
space: colorSpace, bitmapInfo: bitmapInfo) {
// Scale / Translate
context.scaleBy(x: scaleFactor, y: -scaleFactor)
context.translateBy(x: 0, y: -textFrame.size.height)
// Translate for origin
context.translateBy(x: -textFrame.origin.x, y: -textFrame.origin.y)

// Draw the specified text using the provided graphics context.
drawText(textRange, in: context)

// Generate the image and preview.
if let image = context.makeImage() {
let preview = NSTextPreview(snapshotImage: image,
presentationFrame: textFrame,
candidateRects: textRects)
previews.append(preview)
}
}
}

completion(previews)
}

In addition to providing the initial image, use the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:prepareFor:for:in:completion:)` method to hide the specified range of text in your view. UIKit places the image from your `NSTextPreview` object in your view at the location you specified. When the animations finish, Writing Tools calls the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:finish:for:in:completion:)` method so you can show the text in the specified range again.

### Create proofreading marks for your content

If someone chooses a proofreading option, Writing Tools evaluates your view’s text and asks you to provide proofreading marks to decorate the view. For each mark, Writing Tools asks you to provide a Bézier path that underlines the text in a particular range. The following example uses the view’s layout manager to get the bounding rectangles for the specified range of text. It then flattens those rectangles to create a line shape underneath the text and passes the resulting paths to the completion handler. The code creates separate shapes for each rectangle to account for situations where a proofreading mark extends onto multiple lines of text.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: NSWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsUnderlinePathsFor range: NSRange,
in context: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

var paths = NSBezierPath
for rect in textRects.map({$0.rectValue}) {
let underlineHeight: CGFloat = 2
let newRect = CGRect(x: rect.origin.x, y: rect.origin.y + rect.height - (underlineHeight/2),
width: rect.width, height: underlineHeight)
paths.append(NSBezierPath(rect: newRect))
}

completion(paths)
}

In addition to providing the proofreading mark shapes, Writing Tools also asks you to provide the bounding rectangles for the text itself. Writing Tools uses these bounding rectangles to draw highlights around your text. The following example retrieves the bounding rectangles for the specified range of text and passes a Bézier path for each rectangle to the completion handler:

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: NSWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsBoundingBezierPathsFor range: NSRange,
in context: NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

var paths = NSBezierPath
for rect in textRects.map({$0.rectValue}) {
paths.append(NSBezierPath(rect: rect))
}

### Respond to state changes

During the course of changing content, the state of the Writing Tools system changes based on what’s happening. Writing Tools starts in the inactive state, but quickly moves to other states based on the type of experience it creates. When a person accepts or rejects the changes for the current operation, Writing Tools moves ) method to respond to the following types of changes:

- Use a transition to the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.State.inactive` state to clear any cached data from the previous operation.

- Use transitions to the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.State.noninteractive` or `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.State.interactiveResting` state to determine the level of interactivity with your view.

- Use a transition to the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.State.interactiveStreaming` state to start progress controls or otherwise indicate that Writing Tools is working on the request. In addition, use transitions to and from this state to implement undo coalescing. Specifically, start a new undo group on a transition to this state, and end that undo group on a transition away from this state. Notify Writing Tools of any undo stack changes by calling the `updateRange(_:with:reason:forContextWithIdentifier:)` method.

For more information about how to handle individual states, see the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.State` type.

### Inform the coordinator of external changes to your content

When Writing Tools is active, it tracks changes to the text in your view. If you make changes to your view’s text storage while Writing Tools is active, let the system know immediately. Writing Tools tracks the changes it makes internally, so it needs to know about any external changes to make sure it delivers accurate information to your delegate object. To notify Writing Tools of any changes, use one of the following methods:

- Call the `updateRange(_:with:reason:forContextWithIdentifier:)` method if you change the text that corresponds to text in one of your context objects. Depending on the scope of your changes, Writing Tools might incorporate your changes or abort the current operation altogether.

- Call the `updateForReflowedTextInContextWithIdentifier(_:)` method to report any changes that affect your view’s layout. For example, call this method if the size of your view changes, or if you change the text that precedes what’s in one of your context objects. When you call this method, Writing Tools requests new previews, proofreading marks, and other layout-dependent information.

# NSWritingToolsCoordinator

An object that manages interactions between Writing Tools and your custom text view.

@MainActor
class NSWritingToolsCoordinator

## Mentioned in

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom AppKit view

## Overview

Add a `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` object to a custom view when you want to add Writing Tools support to that view. The coordinator manages interactions between your view and the Writing Tools UI and back-end capabilities. When creating a coordinator, you supply a delegate object to respond to requests from the system and provide needed information. Your delegate delivers your view’s text to Writing Tools, incorporates suggested changes back into your text storage, and supports the animations that Writing Tools creates to show the state of an operation.

Create the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` object when setting up your UI, and initialize it with a custom object that adopts the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` protocol. Add the coordinator to the `writingToolsCoordinator` property of your view. When a coordinator is present on a view, the system adds UI elements to initiate Writing Tools operations.

When defining the delegate, choose an object from your app that has access to your view and its text storage. You can adopt the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` protocol in the view itself, or in another type that your view uses to manage content. During the interactions with Writing Tools, the delegate gets and sets the contents of the view’s text storage and supports Writing Tools behaviors.

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom AppKit view

## Overview

At the start of every Writing Tools operation, you create one or more `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Context` objects with a copy of the text you want Writing Tools to evaluate. Each Writing Tools operation starts with a call to the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsContextsFor:completion:)` method of your `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` object. Use the parameters of that method to determine how much of your view’s text to provide. For some operations, Writing Tools asks for all of your view’s text, but in others it asks for only a portion of the text. When Writing Tools finishes its evaluation, it reports changes property of your context object to indicate what text it considered.

If your context object includes text that you don’t want Writing Tools to evaluate, add the `excludeFromWritingTools` attribute to the corresponding characters of your `NSAttributedString` object. You might add this attribute if the text string includes a code listing or readonly content that you don’t want Writing Tools to change.

## Overview

When Writing Tools replaces text in one of your context objects, it provides an `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.AnimationParameters` object for you to use to configure any additional animations. During a Writing Tools session, you hide the text under evaluation and provide a targeted preview of your content. Writing Tools animations changes to that preview, but you might need to provide additional animations for other parts of your view’s content. For example, you might need to animate any layout changes caused by the insertion or removal of text in other parts of your view. Use this object to configure those animations.

You don’t create an `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.AnimationParameters` object directly. Instead, the system creates one and passes it to the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator/writingToolsCoordinator(_:replaceRange:inContext:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` method of your `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` object. Use that object to specify the blocks to run during and after the system animations.

## Topics

### Getting the animation values

The number of seconds it takes the system animations to run.

`var delay: CGFloat`

The number of seconds the system waits before starting its animations.

The systems provide easy-to-use and highly capable APIs for text editing, such as `NSTextView`, `UITextView`, and SwiftUI `TextEditor`. These APIs handle text rendering, text input, and user interactions, support multiple languages, and provide many features like spell checking and Writing Tools. Apps generally use these APIs to implement text editing.

In some cases, apps may desire to build a custom text editing experience by implementing a custom text engine and integrating the editor with system-provided features, such as Writing Tools. The sample app demonstrates how to implement a basic `NSTextInputClient` view with Writing Tools support.

### Configure the sample code project

To configure the sample code project, do the following in Xcode:

1. Open the sample with the latest version of Xcode.

2. Set the developer team to let Xcode automatically manage the provisioning profile. For more information, see Set the bundle ID and Assign the project to a team.

# NSTextPreview

A snapshot of the text in your view, which the system uses to create user-visible effects.

@MainActor
class NSTextPreview

## Mentioned in

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom AppKit view

## Overview

An `NSTextPreview` object provides a static image of your view’s text content that the system can use to create animations. You provide preview objects in response to system requests, such as ones from Writing Tools. In addition to creating an image of your view’s text, you also specify the location of that text in your view’s frame rectangle. When creating animations, the system places the image on top of your view’s content and animates changes to the image instead of to your view.

Create an `NSTextPreview` object in response to specific system requests. Create an image with a transparent background and render your view’s text into the image using the current text attributes. Construct your `NSTextPreview` object with both the image and the frame rectangle that represents the location of the rendered text in your view’s coordinate system. To highlight specific portions of text, instead of all the text in the image, provide a set of candidate rectangles with the locations of the text you want to highlight.

## Topics

### Creating a text preview

`convenience init(snapshotImage: CGImage, presentationFrame: NSRect)`

Creates a text preview using the specified image.

A view that displays OpenGL content in a view.

macOS 10.0–10.14Deprecated

@MainActor
class NSOpenGLView

## Overview

An `NSOpenGLView` object maintains an `NSOpenGLPixelFormat` and `NSOpenGLContext` object into which OpenGL calls can be rendered. The view provides methods for accessing and managing the `NSOpenGLPixelFormat` and `NSOpenGLContext` objects, as well as notifications of visible region changes.

An `NSOpenGLView` object cannot have subviews. You can, however, divide a single `NSOpenGLView` into multiple rendering areas using the `glViewport` function.

When creating an `NSOpenGLView` object in Interface Builder, you use the inspector window to specify the pixel format attributes you want for the view. Only those attributes listed in the Interface Builder inspector are set when the view is instantiated.

## Topics

class NSOpenGLContext

## Overview

An OpenGL context is created using an `NSOpenGLPixelFormat` object that specifies the context’s buffer types and other attributes. A context can be full-screen, offscreen, or associated with an `NSView` object. A context draws into its _drawable object_, which is the frame buffer that is the target of OpenGL drawing operations.

Every `NSOpenGLContext` object wraps a low-level, platform-specific Core OpenGL (CGL) context. Your application can retrieve the CGL context by calling the `cglContextObj` method. For more information on the underling CGL context, see `CGL`.

# NSEditor

A set of methods that controllers and UI elements can implement to manage editing.

## Overview

The `NSEditor` informal protocol provides a means for requesting that the receiver commit or discard any pending edits.

These methods are typically invoked on user interface elements by a controller. They can also be sent to a controller in response to a user’s attempt to save a document or quit an application.

`NSController` provides an implementation of this protocol, as do the AppKit user interface elements that support binding.

This function takes a buffer of glyphs, specified in the `glBuf` parameter, and packs them into a condensed character array. The character array is returned in the `packedGlyphs` parameter, which should have enough space for at least ((4 \* count) + 1) bytes to guarantee that the packed glyphs fit. `count` specifies the number of glyphs in `glBuf`. `packing` specifies how the glyphs are currently packed.

Function

# NSDisableScreenUpdates()

func NSDisableScreenUpdates()

## Discussion

Prevents drawing operations from being flushed to the screen for all windows belonging to the calling process. When you re-enable screen updates (with `NSEnableScreenUpdates()`) screen flushing for all windows belonging to the calling process appears to be simultaneous. You typically call this function so that operations on multiple windows appear atomic to the user. This is a technique particularly useful for synchronizing parent and child windows. Make sure that the period after calling this function and before reenabling updates is short; the system only allow updating to be disabled for a limited time (currently one second) before automatically reenabling updates. Successive calls to this function are placed on a stack and must be popped off that stack by matching `NSEnableScreenUpdates()` calls.

Draws a single-color, bordered rectangle.

macOS

func NSDrawColorTiledRects(
_ boundsRect: NSRect,
_ clipRect: NSRect,

_ count: Int

## Parameters

`boundsRect`

The bounding rectangle (in the current coordinate system) in which to draw. Since this function is often used to draw the border of a view, this rectangle will typically be that view’s bounds rectangle. Only those parts of `boundsRect` that lie within the `clipRect` are actually drawn.

`clipRect`

The clipping rectangle to use during drawing.

`sides`

The sides of the rectangle for which you want to specify custom colors. Each side must have a corresponding entry in the `colors` parameter.

`colors`

The colors to draw for each of the edges listed in the `sides` parameter.

`count`

The number of 1.0-unit-wide slices to draw on the specified sides.

## Return Value

The rectangle that lies within the resulting border.

## Discussion

Behaves the same as `NSDrawTiledRects(_:_:_:_:_:)` except it draws its border using colors from the `colors` array.

Function

# NSReadPixel(\_:)

Reads the color of the pixel at the specified location.

macOS 10.0–10.14Deprecated

## Parameters

`passedPoint`

The pixel location to read, specified in the current coordinate system.

## Return Value

The color of the pixel at the specified location.

## Discussion

Because the `passedPoint` parameter is relative to the current coordinate system, if you wish to read a pixel from a specific view, you must convert points in the view’s coordinate system to the current coordinate system before calling this function. Alternatively, you can lock focus on the view and then specify the pixel coordinate in the view’s coordinate system.

When mapping the specified point to pixel boundaries, this method rounds to the nearest pixel. For more information on how coordinate points map to the underlying pixels, see Coordinate Systems and Transforms in Cocoa Drawing Guide.

func NSGetWindowServerMemory(
_ context: Int,

## Discussion

Calculates the amount of memory being used at the moment by the given `context`. If `NULL` is passed for `context`, the current context is used. The amount of virtual memory used by the current context is returned in the int pointed to by `virtualMemory`; the amount of window backing store used by windows owned by the current context is returned in the int pointed to by `windowBackingMemory`. The sum of these two numbers is the amount of the memory that this context is responsible for.

Calculating these numbers takes some time to execute; thus, calling this function in normal operation is not recommended.

If `nil` is not passed in for `windowDumpStream`, the information returned is echoed to the specified stream. This fact can be useful for finding out more about which windows are using up your storage.

Normally, `NSGetWindowServerMemory` returns 0. If `NULL` is passed for `context` and there’s no current display context, this function returns –1.

# representedPathExtension

A file type based on the passed pasteboard type.

macOS

var representedPathExtension: String? { get }

## Discussion

This function is the inverse of both `fileContentsType(forPathExtension:)` and `fileNameType(forPathExtension:)`. When passed a pasteboard type as returned by those functions, it returns the extension or filename from which the type was derived. It returns `nil` if `pboardType` isn’t a pasteboard type created by those functions.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/runmodal(for:)

#app-main)

- AppKit
- NSApplication
- runModal(for:)

Instance Method

# runModal(for:)

Starts a modal event loop for the specified window.

macOS

@MainActor

## Parameters

`window`

The window to be displayed modally. If it is not already visible, the window is centered on the screen using the value in its `center()` method and made visible and key. If it is already visible, it is simply made key.

## Return Value

An integer indicating the reason that this method returned. See `NSApplication.ModalResponse` possible return values.

## Discussion

This method runs a modal event loop for the specified window synchronously. It displays the specified window, makes it key, starts the run loop, and processes events for that window. (You do not need to show the window yourself.) While the app is in that loop, it does not respond to any other events (including mouse, keyboard, or window-close events) unless they are associated with the window. It also does not perform any tasks (such as firing timers) that are not associated with the modal run loop. In other words, this method consumes only enough CPU time to process events and dispatch them to the action methods associated with the modal window.

You can exit the modal loop by calling the `stopModal()`, `stopModal(withCode:)`, or `abortModal()` methods from your modal window code. If you use the `stopModal(withCode:)` method to stop the modal event loop, this method returns the argument passed to `stopModal(withCode:)`. If you use `stopModal()` instead, this method returns the constant `stop`. If you use `abortModal()`, this method returns the constant `abort`.

- runModalSession(\_:)

Instance Method

# runModalSession(\_:)

Runs a given modal session, as defined in a previous invocation of `beginModalSession(for:)`.

macOS

@MainActor

## Parameters

`session`

A pointer to the modal session structure returned by the `beginModalSession(for:)` method for the window to be displayed.

## Return Value

An integer indicating the reason that this method returned. See the discussion for a description of possible return values.

## Discussion

A loop that uses this method is similar in some ways to a modal event loop run with `runModal(for:)`, except with this method your code can do some additional work between method invocations. When you invoke this method, events for the `NSWindow` object of this session are dispatched as normal. This method returns when there are no more events. You must invoke this method frequently enough in your loop that the window remains responsive to events. However, you should not invoke this method in a tight loop because it returns immediately if there are no events, and consequently you could end up polling for events rather than blocking.

Typically, you use this method in situations where you want to do some additional processing on the current thread while the modal loop runs. For example, while processing a large data set, you might want to use a modal dialog to display progress and give the user a chance to cancel the operation. If you want to display a modal dialog and do not need to do any additional work in parallel, use `runModal(for:)` instead. When there are no pending events, that method waits idly instead of consuming CPU time.

The following code shows a sample loop you can use in your code:

NSModalSession session = [NSApp beginModalSessionForWindow:theWindow];
for (;;) {
if ([NSApp runModalSession:session] != NSModalResponseContinue)
break;
[self doSomeWork];
}
[NSApp endModalSession:session];

If the modal session was not stopped, this method returns `NSModalResponseContinue`. At this point, your app can do some work before the next invocation of `runModalSession(_:)` (as indicated in the example’s `doSomeWork` call). If `stopModal()` was invoked as the result of event processing, `runModalSession(_:)` returns `NSModalResponseStop`. If `stopModal(withCode:)` was invoked, this method returns the value passed to `stopModal(withCode:)`. If `abortModal()` was invoked, this method returns `NSModalResponseAbort`.

The window is placed on the screen and made key as a result of the `runModalSession(_:)` message. Do not send a separate `makeKeyAndOrderFront(_:)` message.

Class

# NSTextContentStorage

A concrete object for managing your view’s text content and generating the text elements necessary for layout.

class NSTextContentStorage

## Overview

An `NSTextContentStorage` object provides the backing store for a view that contains text. This object stores the text in an attributed string object, and defaults to using an `NSTextStorage` object. It also maps portions of the text to `NSTextElement` objects to organize the text into paragraphs, lists, and other common element types found in text content. During layout, TextKit uses these elements to lay out and render the text in your view.

The standard system views use an `NSTextContentStorage` object to manage their text content. When building a custom text view, use this type to store the text for your view. `NSTextContentStorage` works with an associated `NSTextLayoutManager` to lay out your view’s text. When someone inserts new text or edits the existing text, call the `performEditingTransaction(_:)` method and use a block to modify the contents of the `attributedString` property. Wrapping your edits in an edit transaction lets the rest of the text system respond to those changes.

TextKit uses the abstract `NSTextLocation` protocol to identify locations within text. `NSTextContentStorage` manager provides its own implementation of this protocol to represent locations within its storage object. To get the start and end locations, access the object’s `documentRange` property and use them to create new location objects. If you provide your own implementation of the `NSTextLocation` protocol to manage locations in your content, subclass `NSTextContentManager` and implement your own storage object to support those locations.

## Topics

Class

# NSTextContainer

A region where text layout occurs.

class NSTextContainer

## Overview

An `NSLayoutManager` uses `NSTextContainer` to determine where to break lines, lay out portions of text, and so on. An `NSTextContainer` object typically defines rectangular regions, but you can define exclusion paths inside the text container to create regions where text doesn’t flow. You can also subclass to create text containers with nonrectangular regions, such as circular regions, regions with holes in them, or regions that flow alongside graphics.

You can access instances of the `NSTextContainer`, `NSLayoutManager`, and `NSTextStorage` classes from threads other than the main thread as long as the app guarantees access from only one thread at a time.

Class

# NSTextStorage

The fundamental storage mechanism of TextKit that contains the text managed by the system.

class NSTextStorage

## Overview

`NSTextStorage` is a semi-concrete subclass of `NSMutableAttributedString` that adds behavior for managing a set of client `NSLayoutManager` objects. A text storage object notifies its layout managers of changes to its characters or attributes, which lets the layout managers redisplay the text as needed.

You can access a text storage object from any thread of your app, but your app must guarantee access from only one thread at a time.

In macOS, this class also defines properties for getting and setting scriptable attributes of `NSTextStorage` objects. Unless you’re dealing with scriptability, you shouldn’t access these properties directly. In particular, using the `characters`, `words`, or `paragraphs` properties is an inefficient way to manipulate the text storage, since accessing these properties involves the creation of many objects. Instead, use the text access methods defined by `NSMutableAttributedString`, `NSAttributedString`, `NSMutableString`, and `NSString` to perform character-level manipulation.

### Subclassing Notes

The `NSTextStorage` class implements change management through the `beginEditing()` and `endEditing()` methods, as well as verification of attributes, delegate handling, and layout management notification. The one aspect it doesn’t implement is managing the actual attributed string storage, which subclasses manage by overriding the two `NSAttributedString` primitives:

- `string`

- `attributes(at:effectiveRange:)`

Subclasses must also override two `NSMutableAttributedString` primitives:

- `replaceCharacters(in:with:)`

- `setAttributes(_:range:)`

These primitives should perform the change, then call `edited(_:range:changeInLength:)` to let the parent class know there are changes.

Class

# NSParagraphStyle

The paragraph or ruler attributes for an attributed string.

class NSParagraphStyle

## Overview

An `NSParagraphStyle` object stores formatting information for a paragraph of text. The formatting information includes the amount of space between lines, indentations for lines of text, line heights, tab-stop positions, and more. Apply paragraph styles to the text of an attributed string by adding the `paragraphStyle` attribute and setting its value to an instance of this class. The text-rendering system uses the paragraph style information in an attributed string to lay out and render the text.

The `NSParagraphStyle` class manages an immutable set of style information, but you can create an `NSMutableParagraphStyle` when you want to modify the style information before applying it to your text.

class NSTextTab

## Overview

A text tab represents a tab in an `NSParagraphStyle` object, storing an alignment type and location. `NSTextTab` objects are most frequently used with the TextKit system and with `NSRulerView` and `NSRulerMarker` objects.

The text system supports four alignment types: left, center, right, and decimal (based on the decimal separator character of the locale in effect). These alignment types are absolute, not based on the line sweep direction of text. For example, tabbed text is always positioned to the left of a right-aligned tab, whether the line sweep direction is left to right or right to left. A tab’s location, on the other hand, is relative to the back margin. A tab set at 1.5”, for example, is at 1.5” from the right in right to left text.

## Topics

# NSTextList

A section of text that forms a single list.

class NSTextList

## Overview

The visible elements of the list, including list markers, appear in the text as they do for lists created by hand. The list object, however, allows the list to be recognized as such by the text system. This enables automatic creation of markers and spacing. Text lists are used in HTML import and export.

Text lists appear as attributes on paragraphs, as part of the paragraph style. An `NSParagraphStyle` may have an array of text lists, representing the nested lists containing the paragraph, in order from outermost to innermost. For example, if list1 contains four paragraphs, the middle two of which are also in the inner list2, then the text lists array for the first and fourth paragraphs is (list1), while the text lists array for the second and third paragraphs is (list1, list2).

The methods implementing this are `textLists` on `NSParagraphStyle`, and `textLists` on `NSMutableParagraphStyle`.

In addition, `NSAttributedString` has convenience methods for lists, such as `range(of:at:)`, which determines the range covered by a list, and `itemNumber(in:at:)`, which determines the ordinal position within a list of a particular item.

class NSTextAttachment

## Overview

The `NSAttributedString` class uses text attachment objects as the values for attachment attributes (stored in the attributed string under the `attachment` key).

A text attachment object contains either an `NSData` object or an `FileWrapper` object, which in turn holds the contents of the attached file. The properties of this class configure the appearance of the text attachment in your interface. In macOS, the text attachment also uses a cell object that conforms to the `NSTextAttachmentCellProtocol` protocol to draw the image that represents the text and handles mouse events. For more information about text attachments, see the `NSAttributedString` and `NSTextView`.

In macOS 12 and iOS 15 and later, `NSTextAttachmentViewProvider` and `NSTextAttachmentLayout` provide additional capabilities to represent document locations in terms of an `NSTextLocation` or an `NSTextRange`, and provide support for view-based text attachments.

Class

# NSAdaptiveImageGlyph

A data object for an emoji-like image that can appear in attributed text.

class NSAdaptiveImageGlyph

## Overview

An `NSAdaptiveImageGlyph` contains an image that automatically adapts to different sizes and resolutions. The text system creates instances of this type to represent custom emojis that people create using the system interfaces. This type manages multiple images, along with metadata describing how to adapt those images correctly to different fonts and font attributes.

Typically, you receive new `NSAdaptiveImageGlyph` objects only from the text-input system. When someone creates a new emoji and inserts it into their text, TextKit creates an instance of this type to represent it. If your app examines or changes the attributes of attributed strings, preserve the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/foundation/nsattributedstring/key/4395176-adaptiveimageglyph attribute when making any changes. For example, if you filter unknown attributes in a custom text-storage object, update your code to preserve this attribute. The value of the attribute is an `NSAdaptiveImageGlyph` containing the emoji data. You can save the image data with the rest of your content and use the data to recreate the type later.

## Topics

### Creating an adaptive image glyph

`init(imageContent: Data)`

Create an adaptive image glyph from the previously saved data.

`init(coder: NSCoder)`

### Getting the image data

`var imageContent: Data`

The raw data for the image.

### Getting the content metadata

Class

# NSGlyphInfo

A glyph attribute in an attributed string.

macOS

class NSGlyphInfo

## Overview

Glyphs are the graphic representations of characters, stored in a font, that the text system draws on a display or printed page. Before text can be laid out, the layout manager (< `NSLayoutManager`) generates a stream of glyphs, using the character and font information specified by the attributed string and contained in the font file. `NSGlyphInfo` represents a glyph attribute value ( `NSGlyphInfoAttributeName`) in an attributed string ( `NSAttributedString`) and provides a means to override the standard glyph generation process and substitute a specified glyph over the attribute’s range.

Glyph attributes are integer values that the layout manager uses to denote special handling for particular glyphs during rendering. `NSGlyphInfo` enables you to override a font’s built-in mapping from a Unicode character code to a corresponding glyph ID. Overriding the mapping allows you to specify a variant glyph for a given character if the font contains multiple variations for that character or to specify a glyph that doesn’t have a standard mapping (such as some ligature glyphs).

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nslayoutmanager

- NSLayoutManager

Class

# NSLayoutManager

An object that coordinates the layout and display of text characters.

class NSLayoutManager

## Overview

`NSLayoutManager` maps Unicode character codes to glyphs, sets the glyphs in a series of `NSTextContainer` objects, and displays them in a series of `NSTextView` objects. In addition to its core function of laying out text, a layout manager object coordinates its text view objects, provides services to those text views to support `NSRulerView` instances for editing paragraph styles, and handles the layout and display of text attributes not inherent in glyphs (such as underline or strikethrough). You can create a subclass of `NSLayoutManager` to handle additional text attributes, whether inherent or not.

### Text Antialiasing

`NSLayoutManager` provides the threshold for text antialiasing. It looks at the `AppleAntiAliasingThreshold` default value. If the font size is smaller than or equal to this threshold size, the text is rendered aliased by `NSLayoutManager`. In macOS, you can change the threshold value from the Appearance pane of System Preferences.

### Thread Safety of NSLayoutManager

Generally speaking, a specific layout manager (and associated objects) should not be used in more than one block, operation, or thread at a time. Most layout managers are used on the main thread, since it is the main thread on which their text views are displayed, and since background layout occurs on the main thread.

If you want to use a layout manager on a background thread, first make sure that text views associated with that layout manager (if any) are not displayed while the layout manager is being used on the background thread, and, second, turn off background layout for that layout manager while it is being used on the background thread. The most effective way to ensure that no text view is displayed, without knowing deep implementation, is just not to connect a text view to the layout manager.

### Noncontiguous Layout

Noncontiguous layout is an optional layout manager behavior. Previously, both glyph generation and layout were always performed, in order, from the beginning to the end of the document. When noncontiguous layout is turned on, however, the layout manager gains the option of performing glyph generation or layout for one portion of the document without having done so for previous sections. This can provide significant performance improvements for large documents.

Noncontiguous layout is not turned on automatically because direct clients of `NSLayoutManager` typically have relied on the previous behavior—for example, by forcing layout for a specific glyph range, and then assuming that previous glyphs would therefore be laid out. Clients who use `NSLayoutManager` only indirectly—for example, those who use `NSTextView` without directly calling the underlying layout manager—can usually turn on noncontiguous layout without difficulty. Clients using `NSLayoutManager` directly need to examine their usage before turning on noncontiguous layout.

Enable noncontiguous layout using the `allowsNonContiguousLayout` property. In addition, see the other methods in Causing glyph generation and layout, many of which enable you to ensure that glyph generation and layout are performed for specified portions of the text. The behavior of a number of other layout manager methods is affected by the state of noncontiguous layout, as noted in the discussion sections of those method descriptions.

Class

# NSTypesetter

An abstract class that performs various type layout tasks.

macOS

class NSTypesetter

## Overview

`NSLayoutManager` uses concrete subclasses of `NSTypesetter` to perform line layout, which includes word wrapping, hyphenation, and line breaking in either vertical or horizontal rectangles. By default, the text system uses the concrete subclass `NSATSTypesetter`.

### Subclassing Notes

`NSTypesetter` provides concrete subclasses with default implementation interfacing with the Cocoa text system. By subclassing `NSTypesetter`, an application can override the `layoutParagraph(at:)` method to integrate a custom typesetting engine into the Cocoa text system. On the other hand, an application can subclass `NSATSTypesetter` and override the glyph storage interface to integrate the concrete subclass into its own custom layout system.

`NSTypesetter` methods belong to three categories: glyph storage interface methods, layout phase interface methods, and core typesetter methods. The glyph storage interface methods map to `NSLayoutManager` methods. The typesetter itself calls these methods, and their default implementations call the Cocoa layout manager. An `NSTypesetter` subclass can override these methods to call its own glyph storage facility, in which case it should override all of them. (This doesn’t preclude the overridden method calling its superclass implementation if appropriate).

The layout phase interface provides control points similar to delegate methods; if implemented, the system invokes these methods to notify an `NSTypesetter` subclass of events in the layout process so it can intervene as needed.

The remainder of the `NSTypesetter` methods are primitive, core typesetter methods. The core typesetter methods correlate with typesetting state attributes; the layout manager calls these methods to store its values before starting the layout process. If you subclass `NSTypesetter` and override the glyph storage interface methods, you can call the core methods to control the typesetter directly.

#### Glyph Storage Interface

Override these methods to use `NSTypesetter`’s built-in concrete subclass, `NSATSTypesetter`, with a custom glyph storage and layout system other than the Cocoa layout manager and text container mechanism.

- `characterRange(forGlyphRange:actualGlyphRange:)`

- `glyphRange(forCharacterRange:actualCharacterRange:)`

- `getGlyphs(in:glyphs:characterIndexes:glyphInscriptions:elasticBits:bidiLevels:)`

- `getLineFragmentRect(_:usedRect:remaining:forStartingGlyphAt:proposedRect:lineSpacing:paragraphSpacingBefore:paragraphSpacingAfter:)`

- `setDrawsOutsideLineFragment(_:forGlyphRange:)`

- `setLocation(_:withAdvancements:forStartOfGlyphRange:)`

- `setAttachmentSize(_:forGlyphRange:)`

- `setBidiLevels(_:forGlyphRange:)`

#### Layout Phase Interface

Override these methods to customize the text layout process, including modifying line fragments, controlling line breaking and hyphenation, and controlling the behavior of tabs and other control glyphs.

- `willSetLineFragmentRect(_:forGlyphRange:usedRect:baselineOffset:)`

- `shouldBreakLine(byWordBeforeCharacterAt:)`

- `shouldBreakLine(byHyphenatingBeforeCharacterAt:)`

- `hyphenationFactor(forGlyphAt:)`

- `hyphenCharacter(forGlyphAt:)`

- `boundingBox(forControlGlyphAt:for:proposedLineFragment:glyphPosition:characterIndex:)`

# Choosing a Specific Appearance for Your macOS App

Adopt a specific appearance for your windows, views, or app when it is inappropriate to support both light and dark variants.

## Overview

Supporting both light and dark appearances is a good practice, but you might have good reasons to opt out of appearance changes wholly or partially in your app. Views containing user-created content should always reflect the user’s choices. Similarly, you might choose a specific appearance for print-related views so that they reflect what the user sees on the printed page.

The system assumes that apps linked against the macOS 10.14 or later SDK support both light and dark appearances. You can assign a specific appearance to windows, views, and popovers. You can also disable support for Dark Mode entirely using an `Info.plist` key.

For general information about how to support Dark Mode, see Supporting Dark Mode in your interface.

### Assign a Specific Appearance to a View or Window

When you want an AppKit view or window to adopt a specific appearance, assign a custom `NSAppearance` object to it. Normally, your app object inherits the system appearance and propagates that appearance to all windows and panels, and views inherit their appearance from their parent view or window. If you assign a specific appearance to an object at different points in this chain, all child objects inherit the new appearance. For example, if you assign a new appearance to a window, the window and all of its views inherit that appearance.

To assign a specific appearance to a view or window in your storyboard file, change the appearance attribute in the inspector, as shown in the following image.

To make the same change programmatically, assign the appropriate `NSAppearance` object to the window or view’s `appearance` property. The following example code shows a method that assigns the Aqua appearance to a view. Each of the view’s initialization methods must call this method.

class MyContentView : NSView {

func adoptAquaAppearance()
self.appearance = NSAppearance(named: .aqua)
}

}

### Assign a Specific Appearance to Your App

To adopt a specific appearance for your entire app, assign a value to the `appearance` property of your `NSApplication` object. Choose an app-wide appearance only when required by your design. For example, a photo editing app might always use a dark appearance so that users can focus on their photos and not the app’s chrome. The following code example shows how to assign the dark appearance to your app.

NSApp.appearance = NSAppearance(named: .darkAqua)

### Opt Out of Dark Mode

The system automatically opts in any app linked against the macOS 10.14 or later SDK to both light and dark appearances. If you need extra time to work on your app’s Dark Mode support, you can temporarily opt out by including the `NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance` key (with a value of `true`) in your app’s `Info.plist` file. Setting this key to `true` causes the system to ignore the user’s preference and always apply a light appearance to your app.

If you build your app against an earlier SDK but still want to support Dark Mode, include the `NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance` key (with a value of `false`) in your app’s `Info.plist` file. Do so only if your app’s appearance looks correct when running in macOS 10.14 and later with Dark Mode enabled.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsbrowser

- AppKit
- NSBrowser

Class

# NSBrowser

An interface that displays a hierarchically organized list of data items that can be navigated and selected.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSBrowser

## Overview

A browser displays information using a set of columns, which are indexed from left to right. Each successive column displays the next level down in the data hierarchy. This class uses the `NSBrowserCell` class to implement its user interface.

Browsers have the following components:

- Columns

- Scroll views

- Matrices

- Browser cells

To the user, browsers display data in columns and rows within each column. These components are arranged in the following component hierarchy:

Browser
|---Columns [1..*]
|---Scroll view
|---Matrix
|---Rows [0..*]

### Superclass overrides

- `isOpaque` returns `true` when the browser doesn’t have a title and its background color’s alpha component is `1.0`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Protocol implementations

- The `NSBrowser` implementation of `namesOfPromisedFilesDropped(atDestination:)` provides the names of the files that the browser promises to create at a specified location, the result of sending `browser:namesOfPromisedFilesDroppedAtDestination:forDraggedRowsWithIndexes:inColumn:` to the delegate.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsclipview

- AppKit
- NSClipView

Class

# NSClipView

An object that clips a document view to a scroll view’s frame.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSClipView

## Overview

An `NSClipView` holds the document view of an `NSScrollView`, clipping the document view to its frame, handling the details of scrolling in an efficient manner, and updating the `NSScrollView` when the document view’s size or position changes.

You don’t typically use the `NSClipView` class directly; it’s provided primarily as the scrolling machinery for the `NSScrollView` class. However, you might use the `NSClipView` class to implement a class similar to `NSScrollView`.

### Interaction with NSScrollView

When using an `NSClipView` within an `NSScrollView` (the usual configuration), you should access the `NSScrollView` properties that control background drawing state, rather than accessing these properties of the `NSClipView`. This recommendation applies to the following properties:

- `backgroundColor`

- `drawsBackground`

The `NSClipView` methods are intended for when the `NSClipView` is used independently of a containing `NSScrollView`. In the usual case, `NSScrollView` should be allowed to manage the background-drawing properties of its associated `NSClipView`.

There is only one background-drawing state per `NSScrollView`/ `NSClipView` pair. The two objects do not maintain independent and distinct `drawsBackground` and `backgroundColor` properties; rather, the accessors for these properties on `NSScrollView` largely defer to the associated `NSClipView` and allow the `NSClipView` to maintain the state. Note that this state is not cached by the `NSScrollView` object.

It is also important to note that setting `drawsBackground` to `false` in an `NSScrollView` has the added effect of setting the `NSClipView` property `copiesOnScroll` to `false`. The side effect of setting the `drawsBackground` property directly to the `NSClipView` is the appearance of “trails” (vestiges of previous drawing) in the document view as it is scrolled.

## Topics

### Setting the Document View

`var documentView: NSView?`

The clip view’s document view.

### Scrolling

`func scroll(to: NSPoint)`

Changes the origin of the clip view’s bounds rectangle to `newOrigin`.

Scrolls the clip view proportionally to `theEvent`’s distance outside of it.

Returns a scroll point adjusted from the proposed new origin, if necessary, to guarantee the view will lie within its document view.

Deprecated

Constrains the bounds of the clip view while the user is magnifying and scrolling.

### Determining Scrolling Efficiency

`var copiesOnScroll: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates if the clip view copies rendered images while scrolling.

### Accessing the Content Insets

`var contentInsets: NSEdgeInsets`

The distance that the content view is inset from the enclosing scroll view.

`var automaticallyAdjustsContentInsets: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates if the clip view automatically accounts for other scroll view subviews.

### Accessing the Visible Portion

`var documentRect: NSRect`

The rectangle defining the document view’s frame, adjusted to the size of the clip view if the document view is smaller.

`var documentVisibleRect: NSRect`

The exposed rectangle of the clip view’s document view, in the document view’s own coordinate system.

### Setting the Document Cursor

`var documentCursor: NSCursor?`

The cursor object used when the pointer lies over the view.

### Working with Background Color

`var drawsBackground: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates if the clip view draws its background color.

`var backgroundColor: NSColor`

The color of the clip view’s background.

### Overriding NSView Methods

`func viewBoundsChanged(Notification)`

Handles an `boundsDidChangeNotification`, passed in the `aNotification` argument, by updating a containing `NSScrollView` based on the new bounds.

`func viewFrameChanged(Notification)`

Handles an `frameDidChangeNotification`, passed in the `aNotification` argument, by updating a containing `NSScrollView` based on the new frame.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscollectionview

- AppKit
- NSCollectionView

Class

# NSCollectionView

An ordered collection of data items displayed in a customizable layout.

@MainActor
class NSCollectionView

## Overview

The simplest type of collection view displays its items in a grid, but you can define layouts to arrange items however you like. For example, you might create a layout where items are arranged in a circle. You can also change layouts dynamically at runtime whenever you need to present items differently.

You can add collection views to your interface using Interface Builder or create them programmatically in your view controller or window controller code. It is recommended that you configure your collection view with a data source object, which is an object that conforms to the `NSCollectionViewDataSource` protocol. Data sources support multiple sections and the modern layout architecture and are the preferred way for specifying your data.

In addition to displaying items, collection views support the display of supplementary and decoration views. Support for supplementary and decoration views is defined by the current layout object, but both types of views add to the visual presentation of your content. Supplementary views are associated with a specific section and can be used to create header and footer views for a related group of items. Decoration views are purely visual adornments and can be used to implement dynamic backgrounds or other types of configurable visual content.

The layout of a collection view can be changed dynamically by assigning a new layout object to the `collectionViewLayout` property. Changing the layout object updates the appearance of the collection view without animating the changes.

### The Objects of a Collection View Interface

An `NSCollectionView` object itself is a facilitator, taking information from disparate sources and merging them together to create an overall interface:

- The data source object provides both the data and the views used to display that data. You define the data source object by implementing the methods of the `NSCollectionViewDataSource` protocol in one of your app’s objects.

- The visual representation of items is provided by the `NSCollectionViewItem` class. Item objects are view controllers and you use their views to display your app’s data. The data source creates items on demand and returns them to the collection view for display.

- The collection view delegate makes decisions about behaviors. The delegate also coordinates the dragging and dropping of items. You define the delegate by implementing the methods of the `NSCollectionViewDelegate` protocol in one of your app’s objects.

- The layout object specifies the position and appearance of items onscreen. AppKit defines layout objects that you can use as-is, but you can also define custom layouts by subclassing `NSCollectionViewLayout`.

Figure 1 illustrates how the collection view works with its other objects to create its final appearance. The collection view obtains the views for items and supplementary views from its data source, which creates the views and fills them with data. The layout object provides the layout attributes needed to position those items and supplementary views onscreen. The collection view merges the two sets of information to create the final appearance that the user sees onscreen.

There are other helper classes and protocols that you can use to customize the layout behavior and other aspects of the collection view interface. For example, when using a flow layout object ( `NSCollectionViewFlowLayout`), you can modify the flow layout’s behavior using the methods of the `NSCollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout` protocol. When implementing a custom layout, you might also work with `NSCollectionViewUpdateItem` and `NSCollectionViewLayoutInvalidationContext` objects, which help the layout object manage updates.

### Managing the Collection View’s Content

Data for the collection view is managed by the _data source object_—that is an object that adopts the methods of the `NSCollectionViewDataSource` protocol. You are responsible for defining the data source used by your collection view. The data source provides information about the number of sections and items in the collection view and it provides the visual representation of that data. Every data source object is required to implement the following methods:

- `collectionView(_:numberOfItemsInSection:)`

- `collectionView(_:itemForRepresentedObjectAt:)`

The `NSCollectionViewItem` class defines the visual appearance of items in the collection view. Your data source object vends items from its `collectionView(_:itemForRepresentedObjectAt:)` method, creating and configuring the item in one step. Each item is essentially a snapshot of the data it represents. Items are often short-lived because they can be recycled by the collection view and reused to display new data. As a result, never store references to items in your app.

Supplementary views are another way to display data in your interface. Each layout object defines the supplementary views it supports, and different layouts can define supplementary views for different purposes. For example, an `NSCollectionViewFlowLayout` object lets you add header and footer views to each section. Your data source must know enough about the layout to know which supplementary views are supported by the layout object and how those views are displayed. The data source can then provide supplementary views when asked for them.

When your content changes in a way that requires you to update what the collection view displays, call the `reloadData()`, `reloadSections(_:)`, or `reloadItems(at:)` method to perform that update. These methods cause the collection view to discard the views currently being used to display your content and ask for new ones. Never try to modify the views associated with your items directly. The collection view does not maintain views for all items, only those that are currently being displayed. Reloading the items ensures that the views are updated correctly.

For more information on defining your data source object, see `NSCollectionViewDataSource`.

### Inserting, Deleting, and Moving Content

The collection view includes methods for inserting, deleting, and moving items and sections. All of these methods affect only what the collection view displays onscreen; they do not change the data in the associated data source object. As a result, when updating your collection view’s content, always do the following:

1. Update the internal structures of your data source object first.

2. Call the `NSCollectionView` methods to insert, delete, or move items and sections.

When you call methods like `insertItems(at:)` or `deleteSections(_:)`, the collection view fetches any new data from your data source object and then updates the layout. When inserting, moving, or deleting items, the collection view updates the layout for all affected items, which might include items not directly affected by the operation. For example, inserting one item might require adjusting the onscreen position of many other items. When the layout attributes for any visible items changes, the collection view animates those changes into place automatically.

The layout object determines how inserted and deleted items are animated into position. Because newly inserted items are not onscreen initially, the layout object provides the initial layout attributes for those items. Similarly, the layout object provides the final layout attributes for any items that are being deleted. For example, the layout object might specify final layout attributes that are offscreen so that a deleted item animates out of the visible rectangle.

Because individual methods for inserting, deleting, and moving content animate their changes right away, you must use the `performBatchUpdates(_:completionHandler:)` method when you want to animate multiple changes together. The `performBatchUpdates(_:completionHandler:)` method takes a block containing all of the insert, delete, move, and reload method calls you need to update the collection view. All of those operations are captured and performed as a single animated sequence.

### Interface Builder Configuration Options

Xcode lets you configure information about your collection view in your storyboard and nib files. The table below shows the basic collection view attributes. Additional attributes are available based on the selected value for the Layout attribute.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Layout | The type of layout object to use. The Flow, Grid, and Custom options are preferred because they enable the modern collection view behavior. |
| Colors | The option to specify alternating colors for the collection view’s background. |
| Primary | The primary color to use with the collection view. |
| Secondary | The secondary color to use with the collection view. |
| Selection | The options for selecting items. Use these options to enable or disable selections altogether and to specify whether the collection view supports the selection of multiple items or no items. |

The table below shows the attributes you can configure when you set the Layout attribute to Flow.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scroll Direction | The scrolling direction for content. The flow layout allows scrolling in one dimension only. The other dimension is pinned to the size of the collection view itself. For example, when vertical scrolling is selected, the width of the content area is set to the width of the collection view. |
| Item Size | The default size of newly created items. The collection view’s delegate can override the default size values and specify different values for each item. |
| Header Size | The default size of header views. The layout object uses only the dimension that does not match the current scrolling direction. For example, for a vertically scrolling collection view, the layout sets only the width of the footer to the specified value. The collection view’s delegate can override the default size values. |
| Footer Size | The default size of footer views. The layout object uses only the dimension that does not match the current scrolling direction. For example, for a vertically scrolling collection view, the layout sets only the width of the footer to the specified value. The collection view’s delegate can override the default size values using methods of the `NSCollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout` protocol. |
| Min Spacing | The minimum spacing between items and lines. The item spacing is the minimum amount of space for items in the same row or column (depending on the scroll direction). The line spacing is the minimum space between rows or columns. The actual amount of space used between items and lines may be greater than the minimum. |
| Section Inset | The margins imposed on each section. Margins set the distance between the header view and the items, between the sides of the collection view and the items, and between the items and the footer view. |

The table below shows the attributes you can configure when you set the Layout attribute to Grid.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dimensions | The number of rows and columns to display. Use these attributes to configure the grid dimensions. |
| Min Item Size | The minimum width and height for items. |
| Max Item Size | The maximum width and height for items. |

The table below shows the attributes you can configure when you set the Layout attribute to Custom.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Class | The name of the `NSCollectionViewLayout` subclass you want to use. |
| Module | The Swift module containing the class. Leave this attribute blank for classes in the current module. |

The table below shows the attributes you can configure when you set the Layout attribute to Content Array (Legacy).

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dimensions | The number of rows and columns to display. Use these attributes to configure the grid dimensions. |

### Legacy Collection View Support

Prior to OS X v10.11, the collection view always displayed its contents in a grid structure that could not be changed. The data for the collection view was stored in the `content` property, which was often populated with data using bindings. You specified the visual appearance for the collection view’s data by creating an `NSCollectionViewItem` object and assigning it to the `itemPrototype` property. That item object acted as a template and was used to create all of the items in the collection view.

You are encouraged to use the modern collection view architecture when configuring collection views in macOS 10.11 and later. Use the legacy architecture only for apps that must run in earlier versions of macOS.

For more information about how to configure a collection view using the legacy architecture, see Collection View Programming Guide for macOS.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsoutlineview

- AppKit
- NSOutlineView

Class

# NSOutlineView

A view that uses a row-and-column format to display hierarchical data like directories and files that can be expanded and collapsed.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSOutlineView

## Overview

Like a table view, an outline view does not store its own data, instead it retrieves data values as needed from a data source to which it has a weak reference (see Delegates and Data Sources). See `NSOutlineViewDataSource`, which declares the methods that an `NSOutlineView` object uses to access the contents of its data source object.

An outline view has the following features:

- A user can expand and collapse rows, edit values, and resize and rearrange columns.

- Each item in the outline view must be unique. In order for the collapsed state to remain consistent between reloads the item’s pointer must remain the same and the item must maintain `isEqual(_:)` sameness.

- The view gets data from a data source (see `NSOutlineViewDataSource`).

- The view retrieves only the data that needs to be displayed.

For more information about using NSOutlineView in your app, see Navigating Hierarchical Data Using Outline and Split Views.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspathcontrol

- AppKit
- NSPathControl

Class

# NSPathControl

A display of a file system path or virtual path information.

@MainActor
class NSPathControl

## Overview

The `NSPathControl` class uses `NSPathCell` to implement its user interface. `NSPathControl` provides cover methods for most `NSPathCell` methods—the cover method simply invokes the corresponding cell method. See also `NSPathComponentCell`, which represents individual components of the path, and two associated protocols: `NSPathCellDelegate` and `NSPathControlDelegate`.

`NSPathControl` has three styles represented by the `NSPathControl.Style` enumeration constants `NSPathControl.Style.standard`, `NSPathStyleNavigationBar`, and `NSPathControl.Style.popUp`. The represented path can be a file system path or any other type of path leading through a sequence of nodes or components, as defined by the programmer.

`NSPathControl` automatically supports drag and drop, which can be further customized via delegate methods. To accept drag and drop, `NSPathControl` calls `registerForDraggedTypes(_:)` with `NSFilenamesPboardType` and `NSURLPboardType`. When the URL value in the `NSPathControl` object changes because of an automatic drag and drop operation or the user selecting a new path via the open panel, the action is sent. In OS X v10.5 the value returned by `clickedPathComponentCell()` is `nil`, in macOS 10.6 and later, `clickedPathComponentCell()` returns the clicked cell.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsscroller

- AppKit
- NSScroller

Class

# NSScroller

An object that controls scrolling of a document view within a scroll view or other type of container view.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSScroller

## Overview

A scroller displays a slot containing a knob that the user can drag directly to the desired location. The knob indicates both the position within the document view and—by varying in size within the slot—the amount visible relative to the size of the document view.

Typically, you don’t need to program with scrollers; instead, you configure them with an `NSScrollView` object in a Nib file.

Don’t use an scroller when a slider would be more appropriate. An `NSSlider` object represents a range of values for something in the application and lets the user choose a setting. A scroller represents the relative position of the visible portion of a view and lets the user choose which portion to view.

## Topics

`func checkSpaceForParts()`

Checks to see if there is enough room in the receiver to display the knob and buttons.

`var usableParts: NSScroller.UsableParts`

A value that indicates which parts of the receiver are displayed and usable.

### Drawing Scroller Parts

`func drawArrow(NSScroller.Arrow, highlight: Bool)`

Class

# NSSlider

A display of a bar representing a continuous range of numerical values and a knob representing the currently selected value.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSSlider

## Overview

A slider is a UI element that displays a range of values in the app. Sliders can be vertical or horizontal bars or circular dials. An indicator, or knob, notes the current setting. The user can move the knob in the slider’s bar—or rotate the knob in a circular slider—to change the setting.

The `NSSlider` class uses the `NSSliderCell` class to implement its user interface.

## Topics

### Creating Sliders

`convenience init(target: Any?, action: Selector?)`

Creates a continuous horizontal slider whose values range from `0.0` to `1.0`.

`convenience init(value: Double, minValue: Double, maxValue: Double, target: Any?, action: Selector?)`

Creates a continuous horizontal slider that represents values over the specified range.

### Managing the Slider’s Appearance

`var sliderType: NSSlider.SliderType`

The type of the slider, such as vertical or circular.

`enum SliderType`

The types of sliders, used by `sliderType`.

`var altIncrementValue: Double`

The amount by which the slider changes its value when the user Option-drags the slider knob.

`var knobThickness: CGFloat`

The knob’s thickness, in pixels.

`var isVertical: Bool`

An integer indicating the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the slider.

`var trackFillColor: NSColor?`

The color of the filled portion of the slider track, in appearances that support it.

### Asking About the Value Limits

`var maxValue: Double`

The maximum value the slider can send to its target.

`var minValue: Double`

The minimum value the slider can send to its target.

### Handling Mouse-Down Events

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether a mouse-down event both activates the window and starts dragging the slider’s knob.

### Managing Tick Marks

`var allowsTickMarkValuesOnly: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the slider fixes its values to those values represented by its tick marks.

Returns the value of the tick mark closest to the specified value.

Returns the index of the tick mark closest to the location of the slider represented by the given point.

`var numberOfTickMarks: Int`

The number of tick marks associated with the slider.

Returns the bounding rectangle of the tick mark at the given index.

`var tickMarkPosition: NSSlider.TickMarkPosition`

Determines where the slider’s tick marks are displayed.

`enum TickMarkPosition`

The position where a linear slider’s tick marks appear (above, below, leading, or trailing).

Returns the slider’s value represented by the tick mark at the specified index.

### Instance Properties

`var neutralValue: Double`

The value this slider will be filled from. This slider will be filled from its `neutralValue` to its current value. If `neutralValue` has not been explicitly set before, access to `neutralValue` will return `minValue`.

Class

# NSTableCellView

A reusable container view shown for a particular cell in a table view that uses rows for content.

@MainActor
class NSTableCellView

## Overview

The `imageView` and `textField` properties are connected in Interface Builder. Additional properties can be added by subclassing `NSTableCellView` and adding the required properties and connecting them programmatically or in Interface Builder.

The `objectValue` is used when setting the value of the view cell by the `tableView(_:objectValueFor:row:)` method in the `NSTableViewDataSource`. If you use your own custom view cells that are not based on `NSTableCellView` you should implement this property in order to be able to receive changes to cell values.

## Topics

### Represented Object

`var objectValue: Any?`

The object that represents the cell data.

### Displayed Items

`var imageView: NSImageView?`

Image displayed by the cell.

`var textField: NSTextField?`

Text displayed by the cell.

### Getting and Setting the Background Style

`var backgroundStyle: NSView.BackgroundStyle`

This property is automatically set by the enclosing row view to let this view know what its background looks like.

### Getting and Setting the Row Size Style

`var rowSizeStyle: NSTableView.RowSizeStyle`

Returns the row size style.

### Dragging Images

[`var draggingImageComponents: [NSDraggingImageComponent]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstablecellview/draggingimagecomponents)

Class

# NSTableView

A set of related records, displayed in rows that represent individual records and columns that represent the attributes of those records.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSTableView

## Overview

Table views are displayed in scroll views. Beginning with macOS v10.7, you can use `NSView` objects (most commonly customized `NSTableCellView` objects) instead of cells for specifying rows and columns. You can still use `NSCell` objects for each row and column item if you prefer.

A table view does not store its own data; it retrieves data values as needed from a data source to which it has a weak reference. You should not, therefore, directly set data values programmatically in the table view; instead, modify the values in the data source and allow the changes to be reflected in the table view. To learn about the methods that an `NSTableView` object uses to provide and access the contents of its data source object, see `NSTableViewDataSource`.

To customize a table view’s behavior without subclassing `NSTableView`, use the methods defined by the `NSTableViewDelegate` protocol. For example, the delegate supports table column management, type-to-select functionality, row selection and editing, custom tracking, and custom views for individual columns and rows. To learn more about the table view delegate, see `NSTableViewDelegate`.

### Subclassing

Subclassing `NSTableView` is usually not necessary. Instead, you customize the table view using a delegate object (an object conforming to the `NSTableViewDelegate` protocol) and a data source object (conforming to the `NSTableViewDataSource` protocol), or by subclassing one of the following subcomponents: cells (when using `NSCell`-based table views), the row cell view or the row view (when using `NSView`-based table views), the table column class, or table column header classes.

### Enabling the Table View

Use the `isEnabled` property to enable or disable the table view, which the view inherits from `NSControl`. This property affects the visual appearance of the table view differently depending on whether you use a view- or a cell-based table view. When you change the property’s value for a cell-based table view, the system manages the visual appearance of that table view’s rows, and updates them to a state that reflects the value. Because view-based table views permit complex items in their cells, it’s the developer’s responsibility to update each cell’s appearance as appropriate.

# Passing control from one app to another with cooperative activation

Request focus for your app, and coordinate passing control from one app to another.

## Overview

When someone uses your app and another app unexpectedly steals focus, the user experience can be compromised. Not only is it inconvenient for people to switch

When your app needs focus, call `activate()` on your app’s `shared` instance, or its shorthand version `NSApp`:

// Call this function when you want your app to request activation for itself.
NSApp.activate()

// Call this function when you want your app to request activation for itself.
[NSApp activate];

Calling this function sends a message to the system requesting activation for the app. Requesting activation doesn’t guarantee your app gains focus. People ultimately decide which apps gain focus by activating them through their device’s user interface. But if, after considering the user’s intent and larger system context, the system honors your app’s request, your app activates.

### Transfer control from one app to another by yielding and then activating

Passing control from one app to another is a two-step process.

1. First yield from the currently running active app to the target app that you want to gain focus.

2. Then activate the target app when it’s ready.

Only the active app can influence the activation context. It does so by yielding to an explicit target app before the target app activates. Then, when the target app requests activation, the system uses the yield as part of the context when making its decision. If the system honors the request, the active app deactivates, and the target app activates. Otherwise, the active app remains active. `NSWorkspace` automatically handles this for you when opening URLs or applications.

For example, to pass control from your active app to another target app (such as TextEdit, which is a good test candidate because it comes installed on every Mac):

1. Get an instance of the target app you want to pass control to by calling `runningApplications(withBundleIdentifier:)`, passing in the bundle identifier of the target app.

2. Yield to the target app by calling `yieldActivation(to:)`, passing the target app instance.

3. Then activate the target by calling `activate()` on the target app instance.

// When you want to pass control to another application.

// Get an instance of the app you want to activate.
if let targetApp = NSRunningApplication.runningApplications(withBundleIdentifier:
"com.apple.TextEdit").first {
// Yield to it.
NSApp.yieldActivation(to:targetApp)

// Then activate it.
targetApp.activate()
}

// When you want to pass control from your app to another.

// Get an instance to the app you want to activate.

NSRunningApplication *targetApp = [targetApps firstObject];

if (targetApp != nil) {
// Yield to it.
[NSApp yieldActivationToApplication: targetApp];

// Then activate it.
[targetApp activateWithOptions:0];
}

Alternatively, if the app you want to pass control to isn’t currently running, call `yieldActivation(toApplicationWithBundleIdentifier:)` on the `NSApp` instance, passing in the bundle identifier of the target app you want to activate.

// Call this function from the active process.
// Yield to the app using the app's bundleIdentifier.
NSApp.yieldActivation(toApplicationWithBundleIdentifier: "com.example.targetApp")

// Call this function from the active process.
// Yield to the app using the app's bundleIdentifier.
[NSApp yieldActivationToApplicationWithBundleIdentifier: @"com.example.targetApp"];

Then call `activate()` on the target app when it’s ready to gain focus.

// Call this function from the target process.
// Have the app activate itself when it's ready.
NSApp.activate()

// Call this function from the target process.
// Have the app activate itself when it's ready.
[NSApp activate];

Choosing between `NSRunningApplication` or `NSApplication` for activation depends on which app you want to initiate the activation. Use `NSRunningApplication` if you want the active app to control when the target app activates. Use `NSApplication` (or `NSApp`) if you want the target app to activate itself.

### Replace calls to deactivate

When you call `yieldActivation(to:)`, there’s no need to call `deactivate()` on the app losing focus. Cooperative activation APIs cause the receiver to draw inactive when another app activates. This is typically the behavior you want.

Replace calls to `deactivate()` with `yieldActivation(to:)` or equivalent. There’s also no need to call `deactivate()` if an app is hidden by calling `hide()`. The system implies deactivation when the app hides.

### Activating and deactivating the app

`func activate()`

Activates the receiver app, if appropriate.

`func deactivate()`

Deactivates the receiver.

`var isActive: Bool`

A Boolean value indicating whether this is the active app.

Instance Property

# runningApplications

Returns an array of running apps.

var runningApplications: [NSRunningApplication] { get }

## Return Value

An array of `NSRunningApplication` instances. This value is key-value observing compliant.

## Discussion

The order of the array is unspecified, but it is stable, meaning that the relative order of particular apps will not change across multiple calls to `runningApplications`. See `NSRunningApplication` for more information on `NSRunningApplication`.

Similar to the `NSRunningApplication` class’s properties, this property will only change when the main run loop runs in a common mode. Instead of polling, use key-value observing to be notified of changes to this array property.

You can safely call this method from any of your app’s threads. The method returns its value atomically.

inFileViewerRootedAtPath rootFullPath: String

## Parameters

`fullPath`

The full path of the file to select.

`rootFullPath`

The path to use for the file viewer. If you specify a nonempty path string, this method opens a new file viewer. If you specify an empty string ( `@""`), this method selects the file in the main viewer.

## Return Value

`true` if the file was successfully selected; otherwise, `false`.

## Discussion

In macOS 10.5 and later, this method does not follow symlinks when selecting the file. If the `fullPath` parameter contains any symlinks, this method selects the symlink instead of the file it targets. If you want to select the target file, use the `resolvingSymlinksInPath` method to resolve any symlinks before calling this method.

macOS

func setIcon(
_ image: NSImage?,
forFile fullPath: String,
options: NSWorkspace.IconCreationOptions = []

## Parameters

`image`

The image to use as the icon for the file or directory.

`fullPath`

The full path of the file or directory.

`options`

The icon representations to generate from the image. You specify this value by combining the appropriate `NSWorkspace.IconCreationOptions` constants, using the C bitwise `OR` operator. Specify `0` if you want to generate icons in all available icon representation formats.

## Return Value

`true` if the icon was set; otherwise, `false`.

## Discussion

The `image` can be an arbitrary image, with or without transparency. The method automatically scales this image (as needed) to generate the icon representations. The file or folder must exist and be writable by the user.

This method uses the image to set an icon with a size of 512 pixels by 512 pixels. If you specify the `exclude10_4ElementsIconCreationOption` option (not recommended), this method creates an icon that is compatible with the Finder from macOS 10.2 or earlier.

| --- | --- |
| `@"NSApplicationPath"` | The full path to the app, as a `NSString` object. |
| `@"NSApplicationName"` | The app’s name, as an `NSString` object. |
| `@"NSApplicationBundleIdentifier"` | The app’s bundle identifier, as an `NSString` object. |
| `@"NSApplicationProcessIdentifier"` | The app’s process ID, as an `NSNumber` object. |
| `@"NSApplicationProcessSerialNumberHigh"` | The high long of the process serial number (PSN), as an `NSNumber` object. |
| `@"NSApplicationProcessSerialNumberLow"` | The low long of the process serial number (PSN), as an `NSNumber` object. |

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/applicationdidchangeocclusionstate(_:)

#app-main)

- AppKit
- NSApplicationDelegate
- applicationDidChangeOcclusionState(\_:)

Instance Method

# applicationDidChangeOcclusionState(\_:)

Tells the delegate about changes to the app’s occlusion state.

@MainActor
optional func applicationDidChangeOcclusionState(_ notification: Notification)

## Parameters

`notification`

A notification named `didChangeOcclusionStateNotification`. Calling the `object` method of this notification returns the `NSApplication` object itself.

## Discussion

Upon receiving this method, you can query the application for its occlusion state. Note that this only notifies about changes in the state of the occlusion, not when the occlusion region changes. You can use this method to increase responsiveness and save power by halting any expensive calculations that the user can not see.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/application(_:delegatehandleskey:)

#app-main)

- AppKit
- NSApplicationDelegate
- application(\_:delegateHandlesKey:)

Instance Method

# application(\_:delegateHandlesKey:)

Returns a Boolean value that indicates if the app supports the specified scripting key.

macOS

@MainActor
optional func application(
_ sender: NSApplication,
delegateHandlesKey key: String

## Parameters

`sender`

The app object associated with the delegate.

`key`

The key to be handled.

## Return Value

`true` if your delegate handles the key or `false` if it does not.

## Discussion

Implement this method and return `true` if your delegate handles the specified `key`, Your delegate must be able get or set the scriptable property or element that corresponds to that key. You need to handle only your app’s custom commands. The app already implements methods for each of the keys that it handles, where the method name matches the key.

For example, a scriptable app that doesn’t use Cocoa’s document-based app architecture can implement this method to supply its own document ordering. You want to do this because the standard app delegate expects to work with a document-based app. The TextEdit app (whose source is distributed with macOS developer tools) provides the following implementation:

return [key isEqualToString:@"orderedDocuments"];

TextEdit then implements the `orderedDocuments` method in its controller class to return an ordered list of documents. An app with its own window ordering might add a test for the key `orderedWindows` so that its delegate can provide its own version of `orderedWindows`.

Type Property

# shared

Returns the application instance, creating it if it doesn’t exist yet.

macOS

@MainActor
class var shared: NSApplication { get }

## Return Value

The shared application object.

## Mentioned in

Passing control from one app to another with cooperative activation

## Discussion

This method also makes a connection to the window server and completes other initialization. Your program should invoke this method as one of the first statements in `main()`; this invoking is done for you if you create your application with Xcode. To retrieve the `NSApplication` instance after it has been created, use the global variable `NSApp` or invoke this method.

Instance Method

# run()

Starts the main event loop.

macOS

@MainActor
func run()

## Discussion

The loop continues until a `stop(_:)` or `terminate(_:)` message is received. Upon each iteration through the loop, the next available event from the window server is stored and then dispatched by sending it to `NSApp` using `sendEvent(_:)`.

After creating the `NSApplication` object, the `main` function should load your app’s main nib file and then start the event loop by sending the `NSApplication` object a `run()` message. If you create an Cocoa app project in Xcode, this `main` function is implemented for you.

Instance Method

# sendEvent(\_:)

Dispatches an event to other objects.

macOS

@MainActor
func sendEvent(_ event: NSEvent)

## Parameters

`event`

The event object to dispatch.

## Discussion

You rarely invoke `sendEvent(_:)` directly, although you might want to override this method to perform some action on every event. `sendEvent(_:)` messages are sent from the main event loop (the `run()` method). `sendEvent(_:)` is the method that dispatches events to the appropriate responders— `NSApp` handles app events, the `NSWindow` object indicated in the event record handles window-related events, and mouse and key events are forwarded to the appropriate `NSWindow` object for further dispatching.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/requestuserattention(_:)

#app-main)

- AppKit
- NSApplication
- requestUserAttention(\_:)

Instance Method

# requestUserAttention(\_:)

Starts a user attention request.

macOS

@MainActor

## Parameters

`requestType`

The severity of the request. For a list of possible values, see `NSApplication.RequestUserAttentionType`.

## Return Value

The identifier for the request. You can use this value to cancel the request later using the `cancelUserAttentionRequest(_:)` method.

## Discussion

Activating the app cancels the user attention request. A spoken notification will occur if spoken notifications are enabled. Sending `requestUserAttention(_:)` to an app that is already active has no effect.

If the inactive app presents a modal panel, this method will be invoked with `NSCriticalRequest` automatically. The modal panel is not brought to the front for an inactive app.

## See Also

### Managing user attention requests

`enum RequestUserAttentionType`

These constants specify the level of severity of a user attention request and are used by `cancelUserAttentionRequest(_:)` and `requestUserAttention(_:)`.

`func cancelUserAttentionRequest(Int)`

`func reply(toOpenOrPrint: NSApplication.DelegateReply)`

Handles errors that might occur when the user attempts to open or print files.

- nextEvent(matching:until:inMode:dequeue:)

Instance Method

# nextEvent(matching:until:inMode:dequeue:)

Returns the next event matching a given mask, or `nil` if no such event is found before a specified expiration date.

macOS

@MainActor
func nextEvent(
matching mask: NSEvent.EventTypeMask,
until expiration: Date?,
inMode mode: RunLoop.Mode,
dequeue deqFlag: Bool

## Parameters

`mask`

Contains one or more flags indicating the types of events to return. The constants section of the `NSEvent` class defines the constants you can add together to create this mask. The `discardEvents(matching:before:)` method also lists several of these constants.

`expiration`

The expiration date for the current event request. Specifying nil for this parameter is equivalent to returning a date object using the `distantPast` method.

`mode`

The run loop mode in which to run while looking for events. The mode you specify also determines which timers and run-loop observers may fire while the app waits for the event.

`deqFlag`

Specify `true` if you want the event removed from the queue.

## Return Value

The event object whose type matches one of the event types specified by the `mask` parameter.

## Discussion

You can use this method to short circuit normal event dispatching and get your own events. For example, you may want to do this in response to a mouse-down event in order to track the mouse while its button is down. (In such an example, you’d pass the appropriate event types for mouse-dragged and mouse-up events to the `mask` parameter and specify the `NSEventTrackingRunLoopMode` run loop mode). Events that don’t match one of the specified event types are left in the queue.

You can specify one of the run loop modes defined by AppKit or a custom run loop mode used specifically by your app. AppKit defines the following run-loop modes:

- `NSDefaultRunLoopMode`

- `NSEventTrackingRunLoopMode`

- `NSModalPanelRunLoopMode`

- `NSConnectionReplyMode`

## See Also

### Related Documentation

Starts a modal event loop for the specified window.

### Managing the event loop

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/discardevents(matching:before:)

#app-main)

- AppKit

- discardEvents(matching:before:)

Instance Method

# discardEvents(matching:before:)

Removes all events matching the given mask and generated before the specified event.

macOS

@MainActor
func discardEvents(
matching mask: NSEvent.EventTypeMask,
before lastEvent: NSEvent?
)

## Parameters

`mask`

Contains one or more flags indicating the types of events to discard. The constants section of the `NSEvent` class defines the constants you can add together to create this mask. The discussion section also lists some of the constants that are typically used.

`lastEvent`

A marker event that you use to indicate which events should be discarded. Events that occurred before this event are discarded but those that occurred after it are not.

## Discussion

Use this method to ignore any events that occurred before a specific event. For example, suppose your app has a tracking loop that you exit when the user releases the mouse button. You could use this method, specifying `NSAnyEventMask` as the mask argument and the ending mouse-up event as the `lastEvent` argument, to discard all events that occurred while you were tracking mouse movements in your loop. Passing the mouse-up event as `lastEvent` ensures that any events that might have occurred after the mouse-up event (that is, that appear in the queue after the mouse-up event) aren’t discarded.

For the `mask` parameter, you can add together event type constants such as the following:

- `NSLeftMouseDownMask`

- `NSLeftMouseUpMask`

- `NSRightMouseDownMask`

- `NSRightMouseUpMask`

- `NSMouseMovedMask`

- `NSLeftMouseDraggedMask`

- `NSRightMouseDraggedMask`

- `NSMouseEnteredMask`

- `NSMouseExitedMask`

- `NSKeyDownMask`

- `NSKeyUpMask`

- `NSFlagsChangedMask`

- `NSPeriodicMask`

- `NSCursorUpdateMask`

- `NSAnyEventMask`

This method can also be called in subthreads. Events posted in subthreads bubble up in the main thread event queue.

## Discussion

The `run()` method calls this method before it starts the event loop. When this method begins, it posts an `willFinishLaunchingNotification` to the default notification center. If you override `finishLaunching()`, the subclass method should invoke the superclass method.

macOS

@MainActor
func stop(_ sender: Any?)

## Parameters

`sender`

The object that sent this message.

## Discussion

This method notifies the app that you want to exit the current run loop as soon as it finishes processing the current `NSEvent` object. This method doesn’t forcibly exit the current run loop. Instead it sets a flag that the app checks only after it finishes dispatching an actual event object. For example, you could call this method from an action method responding to a button click or from one of the many methods defined by the `NSResponder` class. However, calling this method from a timer or run-loop observer routine wouldn’t stop the run loop because they don’t result in the posting of an `NSEvent` object.

If you call this method from an event handler running in your main run loop, the app object exits out of the `run()` method, thereby returning control to the `main()` function. If you call this method from within a modal event loop, it will exit the modal loop instead of the main event loop.

## Parameters

`action`

The action message you want to dispatch.

`object`

The target object that defines the specified selector.

## Return Value

`true` if either the receiver or its delegate can accept the specified selector; otherwise, `false`. This method also returns `false` if `aSelector` is `nil`.

## Discussion

The receiver tries to perform the method `aSelector` using its inherited `tryToPerform(_:with:)` method of `NSResponder`. If the receiver doesn’t perform `aSelector`, the delegate is given the opportunity to perform it using its inherited `perform(_:with:)` method of `NSObject`.

macOS

@MainActor

from sender: Any?

## Parameters

`action`

The action message you want to send.

`target`

The target object that defines the specified action message.

`sender`

The object to pass for the action message’s parameter.

## Return Value

`true` if the action was successfully sent; otherwise `false`. This method also returns `false` if `anAction` is `nil`.

## Discussion

If `aTarget` is `nil`, `shared` looks for an object that can respond to the message—that is, an object that implements a method matching `anAction`. It begins with the first responder of the key window. If the first responder can’t respond, it tries the first responder’s next responder and continues following next responder links up the responder chain. If none of the objects in the key window’s responder chain can handle the message, `shared` attempts to send the message to the key window’s delegate.

If the delegate doesn’t respond and the main window is different from the key window, `shared` begins again with the first responder in the main window. If objects in the main window can’t respond, `shared` attempts to send the message to the main window’s delegate. If still no object has responded, `shared` tries to handle the message itself. If `shared` can’t respond, it attempts to send the message to its own delegate.

Searches for an object that can receive the message specified by the given selector.

macOS

@MainActor
func target(
forAction action: Selector,
to target: Any?,
from sender: Any?

## Parameters

`action`

The desired action message. May be `nil`, in which case this method will return `nil`.

`target`

The target object to check. Specify `nil` if you want to search the responder chain starting with the current first responder.

`sender`

The potential sender for the action message.

## Return Value

The object that can accept the specified action message or `nil` if no target object can receive the message from the specified `sender`. Returns `nil` if `anAction` is `nil`.

## Discussion

The system looks for an object that implements a method matching `anAction`.

If `aTarget` is specified, the system verifies that it’s a valid target for the provided action and sender, returning `aTarget` if valid, `nil` otherwise.

If the provided target is `nil`, the search begins with the first responder of the key window. The system follows the responder object looking for targets. If no object capable of handling the message is found in the responder chain, the system returns `nil`.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/terminate(_:)

Instance Method

# terminate(\_:)

Terminates the receiver.

macOS

@MainActor
func terminate(_ sender: Any?)

## Parameters

`sender`

Typically, this parameter contains the object that initiated the termination request.

## Discussion

This method is typically invoked when the user chooses Quit or Exit from the app’s menu.

When invoked, this method performs several steps to process the termination request. First, it asks the app’s document controller (if one exists) to save any unsaved changes in its documents. During this process, the document controller can cancel termination in response to input from the user. If the document controller doesn’t cancel the operation, this method then calls the delegate’s `applicationShouldTerminate(_:)` method. If `applicationShouldTerminate(_:)` returns `NSApplication.TerminateReply.terminateCancel`, the termination process is aborted and control is handed , the app runs its run loop in the `NSModalPanelRunLoopMode` mode until the `reply(toApplicationShouldTerminate:)` method is called with the value `true` or `false`. If the `applicationShouldTerminate(_:)` method returns `NSApplication.TerminateReply.terminateNow`, this method posts a `willTerminateNotification` notification to the default notification center.

Don’t bother to put final cleanup code in your app’s `main()` function—it will never be executed. If cleanup is necessary, perform that cleanup in the delegate’s `applicationWillTerminate(_:)` method.

@MainActor
func disableRelaunchOnLogin()

## Discussion

Invoking this method will prevent the app from relaunching when the user next logs in to their account.

If your app shouldn’t be relaunched because it launches via some other mechanism (for example, `launchd`), then the recommended usage is to call this method once, and never pair it with an `enableRelaunchOnLogin()` method.

If your app shouldn’t be relaunched because it triggers a restart, for example an installer, then the recommended usage is to invoke this method immediately before you attempt to trigger a restart, and `enableRelaunchOnLogin()` immediately after. This is because the user may cancel restarting; if the user later restarts for another reason, then your app should be brought back.

This methods is thread safe.

- NSApplication
- currentSystemPresentationOptions

Instance Property

# currentSystemPresentationOptions

The set of app presentation options that are currently in effect for the system.

@MainActor
var currentSystemPresentationOptions: NSApplication.PresentationOptions { get }

## Return Value

The presentation options. The constants are listed in `NSApplication.PresentationOptions` and can combined using a C bitwise OR operator.

## Discussion

This property contains the presentation options that have been put into effect by the currently active app. You can use key-value observing on this property to receive notifications when:

- The client is the active app and makes a change itself using either the `presentationOptions` property or the `SetSystemUIMode` function.

- Another app is active and makes presentation changes of its own.

- Another app becomes active and causes the active set of presentation options to change.

Key-value observing notifications aren’t sent when one of the above conditions occur, but has the same set of presentation options as the previously active app.

struct PresentationOptions

## Overview

There are restrictions on the combination of presentation options that can be set simultaneously:

- `autoHideDock` and `hideDock` are mutually exclusive: You may specify one or the other, but not both.

- `autoHideMenuBar` and `hideMenuBar` are mutually exclusive: You may specify one or the other, but not both.

- If you specify `hideMenuBar`, it must be accompanied by `hideDock`.

- If you specify `autoHideMenuBar`, it must be accompanied by either `hideDock` or `autoHideDock`.

- If you specify any of `disableProcessSwitching`, `disableForceQuit`, `disableSessionTermination`, or `disableMenuBarTransparency`, it must be accompanied by either `hideDock` or `autoHideDock`.

- `autoHideToolbar` may be used only when both `fullScreen` and `autoHideMenuBar` are also set.

When `NSApplication` receives a parameter value that does not conform to these requirements, it raises an `invalidArgumentException`.

#app-main)

- AppKit
- NSApplication
- validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)

Instance Method

# validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)

Indicates whether the receiver can send and receive the specified pasteboard types.

macOS

@MainActor
func validRequestor(
forSendType sendType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType?,
returnType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType?

## Parameters

`sendType`

The pasteboard type the app needs to send.

`returnType`

The pasteboard type the app needs to receive.

## Return Value

The object that can send and receive the specified types or `nil` if the receiver knows of no object that can send and receive data of that type.

## Discussion

This message is sent to all responders in a responder chain. `NSApp` is typically the last item in the responder chain, so it usually receives this message only if none of the current responders can send `sendType` data and accept back `returnType` data.

The receiver passes this message on to its delegate if the delegate can respond (and isn’t an `NSResponder` object with its own next responder). If the delegate can’t respond or returns `nil`, this method returns `nil`. If the delegate can find an object that can send `sendType` data and accept back `returnType` data, it returns that object.

## See Also

### Related Documentation

Reads data from the pasteboard and uses it to replace the current selection.

Overridden by subclasses to determine what services are available.

[`func registerServicesMenuSendTypes([NSPasteboard.PasteboardType], returnTypes: [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType])`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/registerservicesmenusendtypes(_:returntypes:))

Registers the pasteboard types the receiver can send and receive in response to service requests.

Writes the current selection to the pasteboard.

### Providing services

`var servicesProvider: Any?`

The object that provides the services the current app advertises in the Services menu of other apps.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/servicesprovider

- NSApplication
- servicesProvider

Instance Property

# servicesProvider

The object that provides the services the current app advertises in the Services menu of other apps.

macOS

@MainActor
var servicesProvider: Any? { get set }

## Return Value

The app’s service provider object.

## Discussion

The service provider performs all advertised services for the app. When another app requests a service from the current app, the app object forwards the request to its service provider. Service requests can arrive immediately after the service provider is set, so assign an object to this property only when your app is ready to receive requests.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/isfullkeyboardaccessenabled

- NSApplication
- isFullKeyboardAccessEnabled

Instance Property

# isFullKeyboardAccessEnabled

A Boolean value indicating whether Full Keyboard Access is enabled in the Keyboard preference pane.

@MainActor
var isFullKeyboardAccessEnabled: Bool { get }

## Discussion

The value of this property is `true` if Full Keyboard Access is enabled or `false` if it’s not. You might use this value to implement your own key loop or to implement in-control tabbing behavior similar to `NSTableView`. Because of the nature of the preference storage, you won’t be notified of changes to this property if you attempt to observe it through key-value observing; however, accessing this property is fairly inexpensive, so you can access it directly rather than caching it.

class let didFinishRestoringWindowsNotification: NSNotification.Name

## Discussion

The notification is posted when the app is finished restoring windows, that is, when all the completion handlers from `restoreWindow(withIdentifier:state:completionHandler:)` have been called. This is always posted after `willFinishLaunchingNotification`, but may be posted before or after `didFinishLaunchingNotification`, depending on whether clients copy the completion handlers and invoke them later. If there were no windows to restore, then this notification is still posted at the corresponding point in app launch (between `willFinishLaunchingNotification` and `didFinishLaunchingNotification`).

The notification object is `shared`. This notification doesn’t contain a `userInfo` dictionary.

## Discussion

Upon receiving this notification, you can query the app for its occlusion state. Note that this only notifies about changes in the state of the occlusion, not when the occlusion region changes. You can use this notification to increase responsiveness and save power by halting any expensive calculations that the user can’t see.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstandardkeybindingresponding

- AppKit
- NSStandardKeyBindingResponding

Protocol

# NSStandardKeyBindingResponding

Methods that responder subclasses implement to support key binding commands, such as inserting tabs and newlines, or moving the insertion point.

macOS

@MainActor
protocol NSStandardKeyBindingResponding : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

`NSResponder` doesn’t implement any of these methods. `NSTextView` implements a subset of them related to text editing. Your responder subclasses can implement any methods that make sense. You can create your own methods as well, but use these if the concepts map to functionality in your app. If your responder subclass is a view that’s key and uses key binding, and the user types a key sequence bound to a command not implemented in your class, nothing happens by default.

Instance Property

# requiresUniversalLinks

A Boolean value indicating whether you require the URL to have an associated universal link.

var requiresUniversalLinks: Bool { get set }

## Discussion

The default value of this property is `false`, which tells the app to open any URL you provide. Set the value to `true` when you want the app to open only valid universal links.

The app must be specifically configured to open universal links, and attempts to open such links fail with an appropriate error if the app isn’t properly configured. Attempts may also fail with an error if the user disabled support for opening links with the specified app.

Protocol

# NSSharingServicePickerDelegate

An interface for managing content for the macOS share sheet.

macOS

protocol NSSharingServicePickerDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Adopt the `NSSharingServicePickerDelegate` protocol in one of your app’s types, and use it to manage interactions with an `NSSharingServicePicker` object. Use your delegate object to customize the services for the proposed items and respond to the selection of a shared service.

For information about how to display the share sheet and configure your delegate, see `NSSharingServicePicker`.

## Topics

### Configuring the Sharing Services

Asks the delegate to specify which services to make available from the sharing service picker.

### Customizing Behavior

`func sharingServicePicker(NSSharingServicePicker, didChoose: NSSharingService?)`

Tells the delegate that the person selected a sharing service for the current item.

Asks your delegate to provide an object that the selected sharing service can use as its delegate.

### Instance Methods

Used to specify the case where the share picker should not support some modes of sharing even if they are supported by the items being shared. Disabling all possible modes at the same time is not supported behavior.

#app-main)

- AppKit
- NSSharingServicePicker
- show(relativeTo:of:preferredEdge:)

Instance Method

# show(relativeTo:of:preferredEdge:)

Shows the picker interface and populates it with the relevant sharing services.

func show(
relativeTo rect: NSRect,
of view: NSView,
preferredEdge: NSRectEdge
)

## Parameters

`rect`

The rectangle the picker should be showed relative to. The coordinates are in the `view` coordinate system. Passing `NSZeroRect` causes the view bounds to be used.

`view`

The view.

`preferredEdge`

The preferred edge of the view to display the picker. See `NSRectEdge` for the possible values.

## Discussion

In macOS 13 and later, the picker displays the macOS share sheet in a popover. In earlier versions of macOS, the picker displays a menu with the available services. When someone chooses a service for sharing the items, the picker notifies its delegate and then shares the content.

The following example shows the basic code to display the picker in response to an action. Update the code to include the items you want to share and to position the picker interface in an appropriate part of your window.

- (IBAction)share:(id)sender
{
NSArray * items = @[];
NSSharingServicePicker * picker = [[NSSharingServicePicker alloc] initWithItems:items];
picker.delegate = self;
[picker showRelativeToRect:[sender bounds] ofView:sender preferredEdge:NSMinYEdge];
}

Instance Method

# writeSelection(to:types:)

Writes the current selection to the pasteboard.

macOS

optional func writeSelection(
to pboard: NSPasteboard,
types: [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]

## Parameters

`pboard`

The pasteboard to receive your data.

`types`

An array of `NSString` objects listing the types of data that you should write to the pasteboard. You should write data to the pasteboard for as many of the types as you support.

## Return Value

`true` if your implementation was able to write one or more types to the pasteboard; otherwise, `false`.

## Mentioned in

Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

## Discussion

A `writeSelection(to:types:)` message is sent to the first responder when the user chooses a command from the Services menu, but only if the receiver didn’t return `nil` to a previous `validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)` message.

After your method writes the data to the pasteboard, a remote message is sent to the application that provides the service the user requested. If the service provider supplies return data to replace the selection, the first responder will then receive a `readSelection(from:)` message.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem

- AppKit
- NSToolbarItem

Class

# NSToolbarItem

A single item that appears in a window’s toolbar.

macOS

@MainActor
class NSToolbarItem

## Overview

An `NSToolbarItem` object displays an image and text string in the toolbar area of a window. You can also create toolbar items that display custom views you provide. Toolbar items provide fast access to common commands or features in the window. For example, the Finder window uses toolbar items to help someone navigate the file system.

You typically create toolbar items at the same time you create your window’s toolbar. The system provides some standard items like spacers you can include in your toolbar. It also provides items that display standard interfaces like the color panel or font panel. For any custom toolbar items you create, provide an action method to call when someone clicks the item.

You can display your toolbar item’s content using a custom view if you prefer, rather than an image and text label. If you specify an `NSSearchField` object for the view, the system automatically adjusts the minimum and maximum size of the search field to the system-standard values.

## Topics

### Creating a toolbar item

`init(itemIdentifier: NSToolbarItem.Identifier)`

Creates a toolbar item with the specified identifier.

`convenience init(itemIdentifier: NSToolbarItem.Identifier, barButtonItem: UIBarButtonItem)`

Creates a toolbar item with property values from the specified bar button item.

### Getting the toolbar item’s identity

`var itemIdentifier: NSToolbarItem.Identifier`

The value you use to identify the toolbar item.

`struct Identifier`

Constants for the standard toolbar items that the system provides.

### Describing the item

The set of labels that the item might display.

`var label: String`

The label that appears for this item in the toolbar.

`var paletteLabel: String`

The label that appears when the toolbar item is in the customization palette.

`var title: String`

The title of the toolbar item.

`var toolTip: String?`

The tooltip to display when someone hovers over the item in the toolbar.

### Getting the item’s visual appearance

`var image: UIImage?`

The image to display for the toolbar item.

`var backgroundTintColor: UIColor?` Beta

`var view: NSView?`

The custom view you use to draw the toolbar item.

### Performing the item’s action

`var target: AnyObject?`

The object that defines the action method the toolbar item calls when clicked.

`var action: Selector?`

The action method to call when someone clicks on the toolbar item.

### Configuring the item’s menu

`var menuFormRepresentation: NSMenuItem?`

The menu item to use when the toolbar item is in the overflow menu.

`var itemMenuFormRepresentation: UIMenuElement?`

The menu item to use for the toolbar item is in the overflow menu in a Mac app built with Mac Catalyst.

### Getting the item’s configuration

`var isVisible: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the item is currently visible in the toolbar, and not in the overflow menu.

`var isHidden: Bool`

`var isBordered: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the toolbar item has a bordered style.

`var isNavigational: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the item behaves as a navigation item in the toolbar.

`var isEnabled: Bool`

`var style: NSToolbarItem.Style`

Defines the toolbar item’s appearance. The default style is plain. Prominent style tints the background. If a background tint color is set, it uses it; otherwise, it uses the app’s or system’s accent color. If grouped with other items, it moves to its own to avoid tinting other items’ background.

Beta

`enum Style` Beta

`var visibilityPriority: NSToolbarItem.VisibilityPriority`

The display priority associated with the toolbar item.

`struct VisibilityPriority`

Constants that indicate which toolbar items to keep in the toolbar when space is limited.

Instance Method

# restoreUserActivityState(\_:)

Restores the state necessary to continue the specified user activity.

@MainActor
func restoreUserActivityState(_ userActivity: NSUserActivity)

**Required**

## Parameters

`userActivity`

The user activity to continue.

## Discussion

Implement this method to restore an object’s state using the specified user activity. The system calls this method on any responders or documents passed to the `restorationHandler` in `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)`. The system calls this method on the main thread. Your implementation should use the state data contained in the specified user activity’s `userInfo` dictionary to restore the object.

On macOS, the system can automatically restore activities managed by `NSDocument` if you don’t implement `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)`, or if you return `false`. When this occurs, the system opens the document using `openDocument(withContentsOf:display:completionHandler:)`, and calls `restoreUserActivityState` on it.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscollectionviewitem

- AppKit
- NSCollectionViewItem

Class

# NSCollectionViewItem

The visual representation for a single data element in a collection view.

@MainActor
class NSCollectionViewItem

## Overview

Item objects are view controllers, and you use their view hierarchies to display your content. The default implementation of this class supports the creation of a simple item that displays a single image or string. If the appearance or layout of your items is more sophisticated, you can subclass and configure the view hierarchy based on your needs.

Items are the most common types of elements displayed by a collection view, and every collection view must have at least one type of item. You use items to represent the main content of your collection view interface. For example, a photo browser app would use items to display individual photos. Remember that items are only the visual interpretation of your app’s underlying data. The actual data is always managed by your app and exposed to the collection view through the data source object, which uses the data to configure the items that are displayed.

The use of items with a collection view requires doing the following:

- Define the visual appearance of your items by specifying what views they contain and how those views are arranged.

- When your interface is first loaded, register your items with the collection view. (You must register your items before the collection view tries to display any content.)

- In your data source object, create and configure items when the collection view asks for them; see `NSCollectionViewDataSource`.

At runtime, items merely present the data they are given. Your app’s data structures are always the original source of content, and the item contains only a copy of that data to present to the user. When the underlying data associated with an item changes, the data source should invalidate the item by calling the `reloadItems(at:)` method of the collection view. Invalidating an item forces the collection view to dispose of it so that the collection view can create a new one with the updated content.

For information about how the collection view displays items to the user, see `NSCollectionView`.

### Configuring an Item’s Views

You configure the views of an item in one of two ways:

- Subclass `NSCollectionViewItem` and create any custom views programmatically.

- Create a nib file containing a single top-level `NSCollectionViewItem` object. Embed any custom views in the root view of the item.

When creating the views programmatically, you typically override the item’s `loadView()` method as you would for any view controller. In your implementation, create the views and add them as subviews to the view controller’s root view. Add accessor properties to your subclass so that you can access the views later and configure them.

When using a nib file, you can use a generic `NSCollectionViewItem` object if your item contains only an image or text field. For more complex item content, subclass `NSCollectionViewItem` and add outlets for any views you need to access later. In Interface Builder, connect your outlets to the views you add to the nib file.

### Registering Items

Before you can ask the collection view to create items, you must register those items using one of the following methods:

- Use the `register(_:forItemWithIdentifier:)` method when your `NSCollectionViewItem` subclass handles the creation of its own views.

- Use the `register(_:forItemWithIdentifier:)` method when you store the item’s views in a nib file.

You must register at least one item type before trying to display content from your collection view. The collection view’s data source uses the `makeItem(withIdentifier:for:)` method to fetch an empty item for configuration. During the initial configuration of the collection view, that method creates all items using the registered classes and nib files you provided. Later on, the method may return a recycled item that can be repurposed with new data.

For more information about how how to register items, see `NSCollectionView`. For information about how the data source object creates and configures items, see `NSCollectionViewDataSource`.

### Legacy Item Support

For apps built before OS X 10.11, you created a template item and assigned it to the `itemPrototype` property of your collection view. To create new instances of the item, you called the collection view’s `newItem(forRepresentedObject:)` method. For more information about how to support older collection view configurations, see Collection View Programming Guide for macOS.

Instance Method

# find(\_:inBook:)

Performs a search for the specified string in the specified book.

macOS

@MainActor
func find(
_ query: String,
inBook book: NSHelpManager.BookName?
)

## Parameters

`query`

String to search for.

`book`

Localized help book to search. When `nil`, all installed help books are searched.

## Discussion

To search for a string in your bundle’s localized help book, you could use code similar to the following:

NSString *locBookName = [[NSBundle mainBundle] objectForInfoDictionaryKey: @"CFBundleHelpBookName"];
[[NSHelpManager sharedHelpManager] findString:@"Hello" inBook:locBookName];

This is a wrapper for `AHRegisterHelpBook` (which is called only once to register the help book specified in the application’s main bundle) and `AHSearch`.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nshelpmanager/registerbooks(in:)

#app-main)

- AppKit
- NSHelpManager
- registerBooks(in:)

Instance Method

# registerBooks(in:)

Registers one or more help books in the given bundle.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`bundle`

The bundle for additional help books. Books in the main bundle are automatically registered.

## Return Value

`true` if registration is successful, `false` if the bundle doesn’t contain any help books or if registration fails.

## Discussion

You use `registerBooksInBundle:` to register help books in, for example, a plug-in bundle. The `Info.plist` in the bundle should contain a help book directory path, which specifies one or more folders containing help books.

The main bundle is automatically registered by `openHelpAnchor(_:inBook:)` and `find(_:inBook:)`.
