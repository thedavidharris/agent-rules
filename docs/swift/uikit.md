Framework

# UIKit

Construct and manage a graphical, event-driven user interface for your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS app.

## Overview

UIKit provides a variety of features for building apps, including components you can use to construct the core infrastructure of your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS apps. The framework provides the window and view architecture for implementing your UI, the event-handling infrastructure for delivering Multi-Touch and other types of input to your app, and the main run loop for managing interactions between the user, the system, and your app.

UIKit also includes support for animations, documents, drawing and printing, text management and display, search, app extensions, resource management, and getting information about the current device. You can also customize accessibility support, and localize your app’s interface for different languages, countries, or cultural regions.

UIKit works seamlessly with the SwiftUI framework, so you can implement parts of your UIKit app in SwiftUI or mix interface elements between the two frameworks. For example, you can place UIKit views and view controllers inside SwiftUI views, and vice versa.

To build a macOS app, you can use SwiftUI to create an app that works across all of Apple’s platforms, or use AppKit to create an app for Mac only. Alternatively, you can bring your UIKit iPad app to the Mac with Mac Catalyst.

# About App Development with UIKit

Learn about the basic support that UIKit and Xcode provide for your iOS and tvOS apps.

## Overview

The UIKit framework provides the core objects that you need to build apps for iOS and tvOS. You use these objects to display your content onscreen, to interact with that content, and to manage interactions with the system. Apps rely on UIKit for their basic behavior, and UIKit provides many ways for you to customize that behavior to match your specific needs.

Xcode provides template projects as starting points for every app you create. For example, the following image shows the structure of an app created using the single view app template in Xcode. The template projects provide a minimal user interface, so you can build and run your project immediately and see the results on a device or in the simulator.

When you build your app, Xcode compiles your source files and creates an app bundle for your project. An app bundle is a structured directory that contains the code and resources associated with the app. Resources include the image assets, storyboard files, strings files, and app metadata that support your code. The structure of the app bundle is important, but Xcode knows where your resources need to go, so don’t worry about it for now.

### Required Resources

Every UIKit app is required to have the following resources:

- App icons

- Launch screen storyboard

The system displays your app icon on the Home screen, in Settings, and anywhere it needs to differentiate your app from other apps. Because it is used in multiple places, and on multiple devices, you provide multiple versions of your app icon in your Xcode project’s AppIcon image asset. Your app icon should be distinctive to help the user identify your app quickly on the Home screen. However, you may vary the details of your icon to accommodate the different image sizes that you must provide.

The `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file contains your app’s initial user interface, and it can be a splash screen or a simplified version of your actual interface. When the user taps your app’s icon, the system displays your launch screen immediately, letting the user know that your app is now launching. The launch screen also provides cover for your app while it initializes itself. When your app is ready, the system hides the launch screen and reveals your app’s actual interface.

### Required App Metadata

The system derives information about your app’s configuration and capabilities from the information property list ( `Info.plist`) file in your app bundle. Xcode provides a preconfigured version of this file with every new project template, but you will likely need to modify this file at some point. For example, if your app relies on specific hardware, or uses specific system frameworks, you might need to add information related to those features to this file.

One common modification you can make to the `Info.plist` file is to declare your app’s hardware and software requirements. These requirements are how you communicate to the system what your app needs to run. For example, a navigation app might require the presence of GPS hardware to provide turn-by-turn directions. The App Store prevents an app from being installed on a device that does not meet your app’s requirements.

For information about the keys that you can include in your `Info.plist` file, see Information Property List Key Reference.

### Code Structure of a UIKit App

UIKit provides many of your app’s core objects, including those that interact with the system, run the app’s main event loop, and display your content onscreen. You use most of these objects as-is or with only minor modifications. Knowing which objects to modify, and when to modify them, is crucial to implementing your app.

The structure of UIKit apps is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, wherein objects are divided by their purpose. Model objects manage the app’s data and business logic. View objects provide the visual representation of your data. Controller objects act as a bridge between your model and view objects, moving data between them at appropriate times.

The following image represents a fairly typical structure of a UIKit app. You provide the model objects that represent your app’s data structures. UIKit provides most of the view objects, although you can define custom views for your data, as needed. Coordinating the exchange of data between your data objects and the UIKit views are your view controllers and app delegate object.

The UIKit and Foundation frameworks provide many of the basic types that you use to define your app’s model objects. UIKit provides a `UIDocument` object for organizing the data structures that belong in a disk-based file. The Foundation framework defines basic objects representing strings, numbers, arrays, and other data types. The Swift Standard Library provides many of the same types available in the Foundation framework.

UIKit provides most of the objects in the controller and view layers of your app. Specifically, UIKit defines the `UIView` class, which is usually responsible for displaying your content onscreen. (You can also render content directly to the screen using Metal and other system frameworks.) The `UIApplication` object runs your app’s main event loop and manages your app’s overall life cycle.

# Protecting the User’s Privacy

Secure personal data, and respect user preferences for how data is used.

## Overview

Designing for user privacy is important. Most Apple devices contain personal data that the user doesn’t want to expose to apps or to external entities. If your app accesses or uses data inappropriately, the user might stop using your app and even delete it from their device.

Access user or device data only with the user’s informed consent obtained in accordance with applicable law. In addition, take appropriate steps to protect user and device data, and be transparent about how you use it.

### Review Guidelines from Government and Industry Sources

Consult these documents:

- Mobile Privacy Disclosures: Building Trust Through Transparency. The Federal Trade Commission’s report on mobile privacy.

- Opinion 02/2013 on Apps on Smart Devices. The EU Data Protection Commissioners’ opinion on data protection for mobile apps.

- Privacy on the Go: Recommendations for the Mobile Ecosystem. The California State Attorney General’s recommendations for mobile privacy.

- Smartphone Privacy Initiative (2012) in English or Japanese and Smartphone Privacy Initiative II (2013) in English or Japanese. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications’ Smartphone Privacy Initiatives.

### Request Access Only When Your App Needs the Data

Request access to sensitive user or device data—like location, contacts, and photos—at the time your app needs the data. Supply a purpose string (sometimes called a usage description string) in your app’s `Info.plist` file that the system can present to a user explaining why your app needs access. Provide reasonable fallback behavior in situations where the user doesn’t grant access to the requested data. For more details, see Requesting access to protected resources.

### Be Transparent About How Data Will Be Used

For example, when you submit your app to the App Store, specify a URL for your or statement as part of your App Store Connect metadata. You can also summarize that policy or statement in your app description.

### Give the User Control Over Data and Protect Data You Collect

Respect the user’s preferences, and take reasonable steps to protect the data that you collect in your apps:

- Provide settings that allow the user to disable access to sensitive information. The operating system does this automatically for protected system resources—like location, contacts, and health data—through the Privacy menu of the Settings app. Extend this behavior to any data you cache from these sources or collect directly. For example, if your users build a social media profile containing personal information, offer them a way to delete the data (including any server copies you have).

- When storing files in iOS, use the strongest data protection level that works for your app, as described in Encrypting Your App’s Files. Use App Transport Security when sending user or device data over the network, as described in NSAppTransportSecurity.

- If your app uses the `ASIdentifierManager` class, respect the value of its `isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled` property. If the user sets that property to false, then use the `ASIdentifierManager` class only for limited advertising purposes, like frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging. See the AdSupport framework for additional information.

- If you must identify users persistently, use the `identifierForVendor` property of the `UIDevice` class or the `advertisingIdentifier` property of the `ASIdentifierManager` class.

### Use the Minimum Amount of Data Required

Request and use the minimum amount of user or device data needed to accomplish a given task. Don’t seek access to or collect data for unnecessary or non-obvious reasons, or because you think it might be useful later.

If your app supports audio input, configure your audio session for recording only at the point where you actually plan to begin recording. Don’t configure your audio session for recording at launch time if you don’t plan to record right away. The system alerts users when apps configure their audio session for recording and gives the user the option to disable recording for your app.

Provide a purpose string that explains to a person why you need access to protected resources on their device.

# App and environment

Manage life-cycle events and your app’s UI scenes, and get information about traits and the environment in which your app runs.

## Overview

In iOS 13 and later, a person can create and manage multiple instances of your app’s user interface simultaneously, and switch between them using the app switcher. On iPad, a person can also display multiple instances of your app side by side. Each instance of your UI displays different content, or displays the same content in a different way. For example, a person can display one instance of the Calendar app showing a specific day, and another showing an entire month.

UIKit communicates details about the current environment using _trait collections_, which reflect a combination of device settings, interface settings, and user preferences. For example, you use traits to detect whether Dark Mode is active for the current view or view controller. Consult the current trait collection of your `UIView` or `UIViewController` object when you want to customize its contents based on the current environment. Adopt the `UITraitEnvironment` protocol in other objects when you want them to receive trait notification changes.

# Views and controls

Present your content onscreen and define the interactions allowed with that content.

## Overview

Views and controls are the visual building blocks of your app’s user interface. Use them to draw and organize your app’s content onscreen.

Views can host other views. Embedding one view inside another creates a containment relationship between the host view (known as the _superview_) and the embedded view (known as the _subview_). View hierarchies make it easier to manage views.

You can also use views to do any of the following:

- Respond to touches and other events (either directly or in coordination with gesture recognizers).

- Draw custom content using Core Graphics or UIKit classes.

- Support drag and drop interactions.

- Respond to focus changes.

- Animate the size, position, and appearance attributes of the view.

`UIView` is the root class for all views and defines their common behavior. `UIControl` defines additional behaviors that are specific to buttons, switches, and other views designed for user interactions.

For additional information about how to use views and controls, see Human Interface Guidelines. To see examples of UIKit controls, see UIKit Catalog: Creating and customizing views and controls.

## Mentioned in

Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience

About App Development with UIKit

## Overview

Apps that make use of `UIDocument` and its underlying architecture get many benefits for their documents:

- Asynchronous reading and writing of data on a background queue, meaning your app’s responsiveness is unaffected while reading and writing operations take place

- Coordinated reading and writing of document files automatically integrated with cloud services

- Support for discovering conflicts between different versions of a document

- Safe-saving of document data by writing data first to a temporary file and then replacing the current document file with it

- Automatic saving of document data at opportune moments and support for dealing with suspend behaviors

In the Model-View-Controller design pattern, a `UIDocument` object is a model object or model-controller object — it manages the data of a document or the aggregate model objects that together constitute the document’s data. You typically pair it with a view controller that manages the view presenting the document’s contents. `UIDocument` provides no direct support for managing document views, but view controllers that subclass `UIDocumentViewController` can present a `UIDocument`, and view controllers that subclass `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` can organize and display `UIDocument` collections.

Document-based apps include those that can generate multiple documents, each with its own file-system location. A document-based app must create a subclass of `UIDocument` for its documents.

The primary attribute of a document in the `UIDocument` architecture is its file URL. When you initialize an instance of your document subclass by calling `init(fileURL:)`, you must pass a file URL locating the document file in the app sandbox. `UIDocument` determines the file type (the Uniform Type Identifier associated with the file extension) and the document name (the filename component) from the file URL. You can override the accessor methods of the `fileType` and `localizedName` properties to supply different values.

The following outlines the life cycle of a typical document:

1. You create a new document or open an existing document.

- To create a new document, allocate and initialize an instance of your subclass and then call `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` on the instance.

- To open an existing document (selected by the user), allocate and initialize an instance of your subclass and then call `open(completionHandler:)` on the instance.
2. The user edits the document. As the user edits, track changes to the document. `UIDocument` periodically notes when there are unsaved changes and writes the document data to its file.

3. The user requests that the document be integrated with cloud services (optional). You must enable the document for cloud storage. You must also resolve any conflicts between different versions of the same document.

4. The user closes the document. Call `close(completionHandler:)` on the document instance. `UIDocument` saves the document if there are any unsaved changes.

A typical document-based app calls `open(completionHandler:)`, `close(completionHandler:)`, and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` on the main thread. When the read or save operation kicked off by these methods concludes, the system executes the completion-handler block on the same dispatch queue as the system used to invoke the method, allowing you to complete any tasks contingent on the read or save operation. If the operation isn’t successful, the system passes `false` to the completion-handler block.

### Implement the NSFilePresenter protocol

The `UIDocument` class adopts the `NSFilePresenter` protocol. When another client attempts to read the document of a `UIDocument`-based app, the system suspends reading until the system provides the `UIDocument` object an opportunity to save any changes made to the document.

Although some implementations do nothing, `UIDocument` implements all `NSFilePresenter` methods. Specifically, `UIDocument`:

- Implements `relinquishPresentedItem(toReader:)` to forward the incoming block to `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)`

- Implements `relinquishPresentedItem(toWriter:)` to check if the file-modification date changed; if the file is newer than before, it calls `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)` with the value of the `fileURL` as the URL parameter

- Implements `presentedItemDidMove(to:)` to update the document’s file URL ( `fileURL`)

In your `UIDocument` subclass, if you override a `NSFilePresenter` method, you can always invoke the superclass implementation ( `super`).

### Create a subclass

Each document-based app must create a subclass of `UIDocument` whose instances represent its documents. The subclassing requirements for most apps are simple:

- For writing operations, implement the `contents(forType:)` method to provide a snapshot of document data. The data must be in the form of an `NSData` object (for flat files) or an `FileWrapper` object (for file packages). Writing operations are usually initiated through the autosave feature.

- For reading operations, implement the `load(fromContents:ofType:)` method to receive an `NSData` or `FileWrapper` object and initialize the app’s data structures with it.

- Implement change tracking to enable the autosaving feature. See Track changes for details.

- When cloud services are enabled for a document, resolve conflicts between different versions of a document. See Resolve conflicts and handle errors for details.

The system typically calls the `contents(forType:)` and `load(fromContents:ofType:)` methods on the main queue. More specifically:

- The system calls the `contents(forType:)` method on the queue that the system called the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method on; writing of data takes place on a background thread.

- The system calls the `load(fromContents:ofType:)` method on the queue that the system called the `open(completionHandler:)` method on.

If you have special requirements for reading and writing document data for which the `contents(forType:)` and `load(fromContents:ofType:)` methods won’t suffice, you can override other methods of the `UIDocument` class. See Override input and output methods for a discussion of these requirements and methods.

#### Track changes

To enable the autosaving feature of `UIDocument`, you must notify it when users make changes to a document. `UIDocument` periodically checks whether the `hasUnsavedChanges` method returns `true`; if it does, it initiates the save operation for the document.

There are two primary ways to implement change tracking in your `UIDocument` subclass:

- Call the methods of the `UndoManager` class to implement undo and redo for the document. You can access the default `UndoManager` object from the `undoManager` property. This is the preferred approach, especially for existing apps that already support undo and redo.

- Call the `updateChangeCount(_:)` method at the appropriate junctures in your code.

#### Resolve conflicts and handle errors

A `UIDocument` object has a specific state at any moment in its life cycle. You can check the current state by querying the `documentState` property, and get notified about changes by observing the `stateChangedNotification` notification.

If the owner enables a document for iCloud, it’s important to check for conflicting versions and to attempt to resolve conflicts. Listen for the `stateChangedNotification` notification and then checking if the document state is `inConflict`. This state indicates that there are conflicting versions of the document, which you can access by calling the `NSFileVersion` class method `unresolvedConflictVersionsOfItem(at:)`, passing in the document’s file URL. If you can resolve a conflict correctly without user interaction, do so. Otherwise, discretely notify the user that a conflict exists and let them choose how to resolve it. Possible approaches include:

- Display the conflicting versions, from which a user can pick one or both versions to keep.

- Display a merged version and giving the user an option to pick it.

- Display the file modification dates and giving the user the option to choose one or both.

Document state, in addition to indicating an inter-file conflict, can indicate errors. For example, `closed` indicates an error in reading, and `savingError` indicates an error in saving or reverting a document. The system notifies your app of reading and writing errors through the `success` parameter passed into the completion handlers of the `open(completionHandler:)`, `close(completionHandler:)`, `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)`, and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` methods.

You can handle errors by calling or implementing the `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)` method; the default implementations of the `open(completionHandler:)` and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` methods call `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)` when a `UIDocument` object encounters a reading or writing error, respectively. You can handle read, save, and reversion errors by informing the user and, if the situation permits, trying to recover from the error.

Be sure to read the description for the `contents(forType:)` method for its guidance on handling errors encountered during document saving.

#### Override input and output methods

If you app has special requirements for reading or writing document data, it can override methods of `UIDocument` other than `load(fromContents:ofType:)` and `contents(forType:)`. These requirements often include the following:

- Incremental reading and writing of large data files

Override the `read(from:)` and `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` methods, respectively.

- Custom representations of document data (that is, not an `NSData` or `FileWrapper` object)

Override the `read(from:)` method when reading document data and the `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` method when writing document data.

- Performing actions before or after reading or writing data

Override `open(completionHandler:)` and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`.

- A custom approach to safe-saving

Override the `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` method.

- Changing the file type of a document before it’s saved

Override the `savingFileType` method to return a file type other than the default ( `fileType`). An example of this is an RTF document which, after a user adds an image to it, should be saved as an RTFD document.

If you override these methods, be aware that all reading and writing of document data must be done on a background queue and must be coordinated with other attempts to read from and write to the same document file. Because of this, you usually call the superclass implementation ( `super`) as part of your override, and if you call other `UIDocument` methods, you usually invoke them in the block passed into a call of the `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` method. Read the method descriptions for details.

#### Access document attributes

If you override any of the document-attribute properties (listed under Accessing document attributes) by overriding the related accessor methods, be aware that the UIKit framework can call these accessor methods on a background thread. Thus your overriding implementation must be thread safe.

### Rename documents

`UIDocument` provides support for changing the document’s title. Security considerations require that clients can’t programmatically rename a file on the file system, and that the system confirms that a person intends to rename their file. To satisfy these restrictions, the system, instead of your app, presents a renaming user interface using a process outside your app. The external process renames the underlying file and reports the new location and handles the rename request internally when a person invokes renaming from the title menu. If you’re using `UIDocumentViewController`, it automatically configures renaming for you. Otherwise, you manually assign the document as the navigation item’s `renameDelegate`.

init(document: MyDocument) {
self.document = document
super.init(nibName:nil, bundle: nil)
self.navigationItem.renameDelegate = document
}

The Rename action appears in the title menu as one of the system-suggested actions. When a person taps the Rename action, the system shows an inline text field for changing the navigation item’s `title`. Upon renaming the item, the system changes the file name in storage as though the person renamed the file in another application.

Prior to iOS 17, to enable the system rename user interface, a client view controller adopts the `UINavigationItemRenameDelegate` protocol and assigns itself as the navigation item’s `renameDelegate`. It’s the client’s responsibility to implement callbacks such as `navigationItem(_:didEndRenamingWith:)` (Swift) or `navigationItem:didEndRenamingWithTitle:` (Objective-C) to explicitly move the file in storage.

class EditorViewController: UIViewController,
UINavigationItemRenameDelegate {

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()
navigationItem.renameDelegate = self
}

func navigationItem(_ navigationItem: UINavigationItem, didEndRenamingWith: title: String) {
// Move the file, update the model, and so on.
}
}

## Overview

Views are the fundamental building blocks of your app’s user interface, and the `UIView` class defines the behaviors that are common to all views. A view object renders content within its bounds rectangle, and handles any interactions with that content. The `UIView` class is a concrete class that you can instantiate and use to display a fixed background color. You can also subclass it to draw more sophisticated content. To display labels, images, buttons, and other interface elements commonly found in apps, use the view subclasses that the UIKit framework provides rather than trying to define your own.

Because view objects are the main way your application interacts with the user, they have a number of responsibilities. Here are just a few:

- Drawing and animation

- Views draw content in their rectangular area using UIKit or Core Graphics.

- You can animate some view properties to new values.
- Layout and subview management

- Views may contain zero or more subviews.

- Views can adjust the size and position of their subviews.

- Use Auto Layout to define the rules for resizing and repositioning your views in response to changes in the view hierarchy.
- Event handling

- A view is a subclass of `UIResponder` and can respond to touches and other types of events.

- Views can install gesture recognizers to handle common gestures.

Views can nest inside other views to create view hierarchies, which offer a convenient way to organize related content. Nesting a view creates a parent-child relationship between the nested child view (known as the _subview_) and the parent (known as the _superview_). A parent view may contain any number of subviews, but each subview has only one superview. By default, when a subview’s visible area extends outside of the bounds of its superview, no clipping of the subview’s content occurs. Use the `clipsToBounds` property to change that behavior.

The `frame` and `bounds` properties define the geometry of each view. The `frame` property defines the origin and dimensions of the view in the coordinate system of its superview. The `bounds` property defines the internal dimensions of the view as it sees them, and its use is almost exclusive to custom drawing code. The center property provides a convenient way to reposition a view without changing its `frame` or `bounds` properties directly.

For detailed information about how to use the `UIView` class, see View Programming Guide for iOS.

### Create a view

Normally, you create views in your storyboards by dragging them from the library to your canvas. You can also create views programmatically. When creating a view, you typically specify its initial size and position relative to its future superview. For example, the following example creates a view and places its top-left corner at the point (10, 10) in the superview’s coordinate system (once it is added to that superview).

let rect = CGRect(x: 10, y: 10, width: 100, height: 100)
let myView = UIView(frame: rect)

CGRect viewRect = CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 100);
UIView* myView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:viewRect];

To add a subview to another view, call the `addSubview(_:)` method on the superview. You may add any number of subviews to a view, and sibling views may overlap each other without any issues in iOS. Each call to the `addSubview(_:)` method places the new view on top of all other siblings. You can specify the relative z-order of subview by adding it using the `insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:)` and `insertSubview(_:belowSubview:)` methods. You can also exchange the position of already added subviews using the `exchangeSubview(at:withSubviewAt:)` method.

After creating a view, create Auto Layout rules to govern how the size and position of the view change in response to changes in the rest of the view hierarchy. For more information, see Auto Layout Guide.

### Draw views

View drawing occurs on an as-needed basis. When a view is first shown, or when all or part of it becomes visible due to layout changes, the system asks the view to draw its contents. For views that contain custom content using UIKit or Core Graphics, the system calls the view’s `draw(_:)` method. Your implementation of this method is responsible for drawing the view’s content into the current graphics context, which is set up by the system automatically prior to calling this method. This creates a static visual representation of your view’s content that can then be displayed on the screen.

When the actual content of your view changes, it’s your responsibility to notify the system that your view needs to be redrawn. You do this by calling your view’s `setNeedsDisplay()` or `setNeedsDisplay(_:)` method of the view. These methods let the system know that it should update the view during the next drawing cycle. Because it waits until the next drawing cycle to update the view, you can call these methods on multiple views to update them at the same time.

For detailed information about the view drawing cycle and the role your views have in this cycle, see View Programming Guide for iOS.

### Animate views

Changes to several view properties can be animated — that is, changing the property creates an animation starting at the current value and ending at the new value that you specify. The following properties of the `UIView` class are animatable:

- `frame`

- `bounds`

- `center`

- `transform`

- `alpha`

- `backgroundColor`

To animate your changes, create a `UIViewPropertyAnimator` object and use its handler block to change the values of your view’s properties. The `UIViewPropertyAnimator` class lets you specify the duration and timing of your animations, but it performs the actual animations. You can pause a property-based animator that’s currently running to interrupt the animation and drive it interactively. For more information, see `UIViewPropertyAnimator`.

### Threading considerations

Manipulations to your app’s user interface must occur on the main thread. Thus, you should always call the methods of the `UIView` class from code running in the main thread of your app. The only time this may not be strictly necessary is when creating the view object itself, but all other manipulations should occur on the main thread.

### Subclassing notes

The `UIView` class is a key subclassing point for visual content that also requires user interactions. Although there are many good reasons to subclass `UIView`, it is recommended that you do so only when the basic `UIView` class or the standard system views do not provide the capabilities that you need. Subclassing requires more work on your part to implement the view and to tune its performance.

For information about ways to avoid subclassing, see Alternatives to subclassing.

#### Methods to override

When subclassing `UIView`, there are only a handful of methods you should override and many methods that you might override depending on your needs. Because `UIView` is a highly configurable class, there are also many ways to implement sophisticated view behaviors without overriding custom methods, which are discussed in the Alternatives to Subclassing section. In the meantime, the following list includes the methods you might consider overriding in your `UIView` subclasses:

- Initialization:

- `init(frame:)` \- It is recommended that you implement this method. You can also implement custom initialization methods in addition to, or instead of, this method.

- doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/oslog/oslogentry/init(coder:) - Implement this method if you load your view from storyboards or nib files and your view requires custom initialization.

- `layerClass` Use this property only if you want your view to use a different Core Animation layer for its backing store. For example, if your view uses tiling to display a large scrollable area, you might want to set the property to the `CATiledLayer` class.

- Drawing and printing:

- `draw(_:)` \- Implement this method if your view draws custom content. If your view does not do any custom drawing, avoid overriding this method.

- `draw(_:for:)` \- Implement this method only if you want to draw your view’s content differently during printing.

- Layout and Constraints:

- `requiresConstraintBasedLayout` Use this property if your view class requires constraints to work properly.

- `updateConstraints()` \- Implement this method if your view needs to create custom constraints between your subviews.

- `alignmentRect(forFrame:)`, `frame(forAlignmentRect:)` \- Implement these methods to override how your views are aligned to other views.

- `didAddSubview(_:)`, `willRemoveSubview(_:)` \- Implement these methods as needed to track the additions and removals of subviews.

- `willMove(toSuperview:)`, `didMoveToSuperview()` \- Implement these methods as needed to track the movement of the current view in your view hierarchy.

- Event Handling:

- `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin(_:)` \- Implement this method if your view handles touch events directly and might want to prevent attached gesture recognizers from triggering additional actions.

- `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, `touchesMoved(_:with:)`, `touchesEnded(_:with:)`, `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` \- Implement these methods if you need to handle touch events directly. (For gesture-based input, use gesture recognizers.)

#### Alternatives to subclassing

Many view behaviors can be configured without the need for subclassing. Before you start overriding methods, consider whether modifying the following properties or behaviors would provide the behavior you need.

- `addConstraint(_:)` \- Define automatic layout behavior for the view and its subviews.

- `autoresizingMask` \- Provides automatic layout behavior when the superview’s frame changes. These behaviors can be combined with constraints.

- `contentMode` \- Provides layout behavior for the view’s content, as opposed to the `frame` of the view. This property also affects how the content is scaled to fit the view and whether it is cached or redrawn.

- `isHidden` or `alpha` \- Change the transparency of the view as a whole rather than hiding or applying alpha to your view’s rendered content.

- `backgroundColor` \- Set the view’s color rather than drawing that color yourself.

- Subviews - Rather than draw your content using a `draw(_:)` method, embed image and label subviews with the content you want to present.

- Gesture recognizers - Rather than subclass to intercept and handle touch events yourself, you can use gesture recognizers to send an action to a target object.

- Animations - Use the built-in animation support rather than trying to animate changes yourself. The animation support provided by Core Animation is fast and easy to use.

- Image-based backgrounds - For views that display relatively static content, consider using a `UIImageView` object with gesture recognizers instead of subclassing and drawing the image yourself. Alternatively, you can also use a generic `UIView` object and assign your image as the content of the view’s `CALayer` object.

Animations are another way to make visible changes to a view without requiring you to subclass and implement complex drawing code. Many properties of the `UIView` class are animatable, which means changes to those properties can trigger system-generated animations. Starting animations requires as little as one line of code to indicate that any changes that follow should be animated. For more information about animation support for views, see Animate views.

## Overview

Every iOS app has exactly one instance of `UIApplication` (or, very rarely, a subclass of `UIApplication`). When an app launches, the system calls the `UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)` function. Among its other tasks, this function creates a singleton `UIApplication` object that you access using `shared`.

Your app’s application object handles the initial routing of incoming user events. It dispatches action messages forwarded to it by control objects (instances of the `UIControl` class) to appropriate target objects. The application object maintains a list of open windows ( `UIWindow` objects), which it can use to retrieve any of the app’s `UIView` objects.

The `UIApplication` class defines a delegate that conforms to the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol and must implement some of the protocol’s methods. The application object informs the delegate of significant runtime events—for example, app launch, low-memory warnings, and app termination—giving it an opportunity to respond appropriately.

Apps can cooperatively handle a resource, such as an email or an image file, through the `open(_:options:completionHandler:)` method. For example, an app that calls this method with an email URL causes the Mail app to launch and display the message.

The APIs in this class allow you to manage device-specific behavior. Use your `UIApplication` object to do the following:

- Temporarily suspend incoming touch events ( `beginIgnoringInteractionEvents()`)

- Register for remote notifications ( `registerForRemoteNotifications()`)

- Trigger the undo-redo UI ( `applicationSupportsShakeToEdit`)

- Determine whether there is an installed app registered to handle a URL scheme ( `canOpenURL(_:)`)

- Extend the execution of the app so that it can finish a task in the background ( `beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)` and `beginBackgroundTask(withName:expirationHandler:)`)

- Schedule and cancel local notifications ( `scheduleLocalNotification(_:)` and `cancelLocalNotification(_:)`)

- Coordinate the reception of remote-control events ( `beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents()` and `endReceivingRemoteControlEvents()`)

- Perform app-level state restoration tasks (methods in the Managing state restoration task group)

### Subclassing notes

Most apps don’t need to subclass `UIApplication`. Instead, use an app delegate to manage interactions between the system and the app.

If your app must handle incoming events before the system does—a very rare situation—you can implement a custom event or action dispatching mechanism. To do this, subclass `UIApplication` and override the `sendEvent(_:)` and/or the `sendAction(_:to:from:for:)` methods. For every event you intercept, after you handle the event, dispatch it

# Creating a Mac version of your iPad app

Bring your iPad app to macOS with Mac Catalyst.

## Overview

With Xcode 11 and later, you can create a Mac version of your iPad app using Mac Catalyst. Configuring your app for Mac can take just a click in a checkbox, although you may need more steps, depending on the features and frameworks that your app uses.

### Configure your app for Mac

To add support for Mac, open your Xcode project and select the iOS target that you want to configure. In the General tab, under Deployment Info, select the Mac checkbox. (If your app supports iPhone only, the checkbox is unavailable.)

When you enable Mac support, Xcode adds the `App Sandbox Entitlement` to your project. Xcode only includes this entitlement in the Mac version of your app, not the iOS version. Xcode also adds My Mac to the list of destinations. Select this destination to run your Mac app from Xcode.

At this point, you may be able to build and run the Mac version of your app. To give it a try, select My Mac as the destination and run your project.

### Go beyond the checkbox

You may find that the Mac version of your app still doesn’t build because:

- Your project includes incompatible frameworks, libraries, or embedded content.

- Your source code references unsupported APIs.

When you enable Mac support, Xcode automatically excludes incompatible frameworks and embedded content where possible for Mac builds of your project. Still, you may need to manually exclude other frameworks or content.

To manually exclude an item, open Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content under the General tab for your iOS target. Then select iOS as the platform setting for the item. This setting excludes the item from the Mac version of your app.

If you have source code referencing APIs unavailable to the Mac version of your app, enclose the code in a compilation conditional block that uses the `targetEnvironment()` (Swift) or `TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST` (Objective-C) platform condition.

#if !targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
// Code to exclude from Mac.
#endif

#if !TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST
#endif

You can use these same approaches to include a framework and code that are available only in macOS. For a framework, select macOS for the platform setting, and enclose the code with a `#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)` (Swift) or `#if TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST` (Objective-C) statement.

### Make your app more like a Mac app

After following these steps, you should be able to run your iPad app on Mac. But before you ship your new app to customers, it needs a few more changes to make it more like a Mac app. To learn more, see Optimizing your iPad app for Mac.

# Displaying a checkbox in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst

Present a switch control as a Mac-style checkbox when your app runs in the Mac user interface idiom.

## Overview

A Mac app built with Mac Catalyst that uses the Mac user interface idiom displays a `UISwitch` as a checkbox when the `preferredStyle` value is `UISwitch.Style.automatic` (the default value) or `UISwitch.Style.checkbox`. If your app doesn’t use the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac` idiom, the switch appears as a slider switch. To learn more, see Choosing a user interface idiom for your Mac app.

### Add text to the checkbox

To display text alongside the checkbox, set the `title` property.

let showFavoritesAtTop = UISwitch()
showFavoritesAtTop.title = "Always show favorite recipes at the top"

### Resize the checkbox

A checkbox-style switch has a default frame size of zero. If you’re not using Auto Layout to determine the size and position of the switch, call `sizeToFit()` to resize it so that it uses the appropriate amount of space needed to display the checkbox and its title.

# Removing the title bar in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst

Display content that fills the entire height of a window by removing the title bar.

## Overview

By default, Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst display a title bar across the top of their windows. A horizontal line separates the title bar from the content of the window.

Some Mac apps such as Messages and Contacts have no title bar in their main window. Instead, the top of the window shows only the Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons with no separator between them and the window’s content. In this UI design, the content area fills the entire height of the window.

The following image illustrates these styles in two windows. The first window displays a title bar, while the second has none.

### Remove the title bar

If you choose to design your window without a title bar, you must remove it from the window. To remove the title bar, set the title bar’s `titleVisibility` property to `UITitlebarTitleVisibility.hidden` and the `toolbar` property to `nil`. The following code shows how to remove the title bar and its separator from the window during the setup of a new scene.

func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
if let titlebar = windowScene.titlebar {
titlebar.titleVisibility = .hidden
titlebar.toolbar = nil
}
#endif

The sample project also shows you how to add contextual menus to views, and how to handle menu-command selection using `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate`.

### Configure the sample code project

In Xcode, select your development team on the iOS target’s Signing and Capabilities tab.

### Add menus to the menu bar

Create `UIMenu` objects and use them to construct the menus and submenus. This sample adds menus to the menu bar when it runs on macOS, and key command elements in those menus also appear in the discoverability heads-up display (HUD) on iPad when the user presses the command key.

The Mac version of an iPad app comes with a standard menu bar. Use the `UIMenuSystem` class, an object that represents the main or contextual menu system, to modify the menu bar.

The sample uses `UIMenuSystem` to add menus and key commands to the `main` system menu by implementing `buildMenu(with:)` in `AppDelegate`. This function receives a `UIMenuBuilder` object that the sample then uses to add and remove menus. Because menus can exist with no window or view hierarchy, the system only consults `UIApplication` and `UIApplicationDelegate` to build the app’s menu bar.

Menu commands consist of `UICommand`, `UIKeyCommand`, and `UIAction` objects that are grouped in a `UIMenu` container.

### Add menu commands to the file menu

This sample inserts a `UIKeyCommand` called Command-O into the File Menu and creates a corresponding keyboard shortcut:

let openCommand =
UIKeyCommand(title: NSLocalizedString("OpenTitle", comment: ""),
image: nil,
action: #selector(AppDelegate.openAction),
input: "o",
modifierFlags: .command)
let openMenu =
UIMenu(title: "",
image: nil,
identifier: .openMenu,
options: .displayInline,
children: [openCommand])
return openMenu
}

Notice that the `UIKeyCommand` title is a localized string using the `NSLocalizedString` function, which can display the menu name in multiple languages.

This sample inserts the Open command into the middle of the menu bar’s File menu:

builder.insertChild(MenuController.openMenu(), atStartOfMenu: .file)

Mac apps also typically include a Print menu command in the File menu. This sample includes both Print and Export as PDF menu commands in the File Menu. These menu commands are automatically inserted when the `Info.plist` contains the `UIApplicationSupportsPrintCommand` key whose value is set to `true`. The application responds to these print commands by implementing `UIResponder's` `printContent(_ sender: Any?)` function.

### Contribute to the edit menu

Editing operations, such as cut, copy, paste, and delete, are commonly used in most apps. This sample app provides these operations through the Edit menu, where the user can edit the sample’s left-side content or its primary table-view content. These operations represent the first-responder functions `cut(_ sender: Any?)`, `copy(_ sender: Any?)`, `paste(_ sender: Any?)`, `delete(_ sender: Any?)`.

This sample implements `canPerformAction:withSender:` to determine if these edit operations are supported.

if action == #selector(printContent) {
// Allow for printing if a table view cell is selected.
return tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow != nil
} else if action == #selector(newAction(_:)) {
// User wants to perform a New operation.
return true
} else {
switch (tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow, action) {

// These Edit commands are supported.
case let (_?, action) where action == #selector(cut(_:)) ||
action == #selector(copy(_:)) ||
action == #selector(delete(_:)):
return true
case (_?, _):
// Allow the nextResponder to make the determination.
return super.canPerformAction(action, withSender: sender)

// Paste is supported if the pasteboard has text.
case (.none, action) where action == #selector(paste(_:)):
return (UIPasteboard.general.string != nil) ? true :
// Allow the nextResponder to make the determination.
super.canPerformAction(action, withSender: sender)
case (.none, _):
return false
}
}
}

### Add commands to control the user interface

In the sample, you can change the primary or left-side table view’s selection by using `UIKeyCommand`. These key commands are connected to the up and down arrow keys and are added directly to the table view. The following example shows how to add the down arrow key as a `UIKeyCommand`:

let downArrowCommand =
UIKeyCommand(input: UIKeyCommand.inputDownArrow,
modifierFlags: [],
action: #selector(PrimaryViewController.downArrowAction(_:)))
addKeyCommand(downArrowCommand)

The sample also demonstrates how to add menu commands as command-key equivalents. The following example shows how to create a menu with all four arrow keys as command keys:

let keyCommands = [ UIKeyCommand.inputRightArrow,\
UIKeyCommand.inputLeftArrow,\
UIKeyCommand.inputUpArrow,\
UIKeyCommand.inputDownArrow ]
let arrows = Arrows.allCases

let arrowKeyChildrenCommands = zip(keyCommands, arrows).map { (command, arrow) in
UIKeyCommand(title: arrow.localizedString(),
image: nil,
action: #selector(AppDelegate.navigationMenuAction(_:)),
input: command,
modifierFlags: .command,
propertyList: [CommandPListKeys.ArrowsKeyIdentifier: arrow.rawValue])
}

let arrowKeysGroup = UIMenu(title: "",
image: nil,
identifier: .arrowsMenu,
options: .displayInline,
children: arrowKeyChildrenCommands)

return UIMenu(title: NSLocalizedString("NavigationTitle", comment: ""),
image: nil,
identifier: .navMenu,
options: [],
children: [arrowKeysGroup])
}

### Display contextual menus

The sample displays a contextual menu through the use of `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate`, an interaction object used to display relevant actions for the content.

For macOS, the user control-clicks or right-clicks the `DetailViewController`. For iPadOS, the user taps and holds the `DetailViewController`. The sample uses `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate` to display Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Rename, and Share commands. This kind of contextual menu is a grouping of `UIAction` objects. `UIAction` is a menu element that performs its action in a closure. In iOS, optionally customize this contextual menu’s highlight preview by using `contextMenuInteraction(_:previewForHighlightingMenuWithConfiguration:)`. This delegate function returns a primary view controller. Override this function to enable menu commands based on the table view state or the state of the pasteboard.

### Adjust the style menu

The sample implements `validate(_:)`, where it can adjust the Style menu as the user selects between one or more font styles: plain, bold, italic, underline.

// The font style menu item check marks used in the Style menu.

// Update the state of a given command by adjusting the Style menu.
// Note: Only command groups that are added will be called to validate.
override func validate(_ command: UICommand) {
// Obtain the plist of the incoming command.

if let fontStyleDict = command.propertyList as? [String: String] {
// Check if the command comes from the Style menu.
if let fontStyle = fontStyleDict[MenuController.CommandPListKeys.StylesIdentifierKey] {
// Update the Style menu command state (checked or unchecked).
command.state = fontMenuStyleStates.contains(fontStyle) ? .on : .off
}
} else {
// Validate the disabled command. This keeps the menu item disabled.
if let commandPlistString = command.propertyList as? String {
if commandPlistString == MenuController.disabledCommand {
command.attributes = .disabled
}
}
}
}

### Add a preferences menu

Mac apps typically display app-specific preferences using a preferences window. The sample adds a preferences window by adding a Settings bundle to the Xcode project’s target. The window automatically becomes available to the user through the Preferences menu command in the Application menu. To learn more about preferences, see Displaying a Preferences window.

# Handling key presses made on a physical keyboard

Detect when someone presses and releases keys on a physical keyboard.

## Overview

In iOS apps and Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst, the system reports key presses that a person makes on a physical keyboard by sending press events to responder objects in the responder chain of the active app.

A responder chain is a linked series of `UIResponder` objects, such as UIViewController and `UIApplication`, that either handle an event or transfer responsibility for handling the event to other responders in the app. To learn more about responders and the responder chain, see Using responders and the responder chain to handle events.

### Detect a key press

To detect a key press that a person makes on a physical keyboard, override `pressesBegan(_:with:)` in a responder object of your app such as the app delegate or main view controller.

To determine what key they pressed, iterate through the set of presses, inspecting the `key` property of each press. Use `charactersIgnoringModifiers` to determine the text value of key, and whether the responder should handle the key press or not. If the responder doesn’t handle the key press, call `pressesBegan(_:with:)` on the superclass to send the press event to the next responder in the active responder chain.

For example, the following code listing handles someone pressing either the left or right arrow.

// Handle someone pressing a key on a physical keyboard.

with event: UIPressesEvent?) {

var didHandleEvent = false

for press in presses {

// Get the pressed key.
guard let key = press.key else { continue }

if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputLeftArrow {
// Someone pressed the left arrow key.
// Respond to the key-press event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputRightArrow {
// Someone pressed the right arrow key.
// Respond to the key-press event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
}

if didHandleEvent == false {
// If someone presses a key that you're not handling,
// pass the event to the next responder.
super.pressesBegan(presses, with: event)
}
}

### Detect a key release

Override the responder’s `pressesEnded(_:with:)` method to detect when someone releases a key. To get information about the key, do the same as you did when detecting a key press; inspect the `key` property of each press in the `presses` set. For example, the following code listing handles someone releasing either the left or right arrow.

// Handle someone releasing a key on a physical keyboard.

// Get the released key.
guard let key = press.key else { continue }

if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputLeftArrow {
// Someone released the left arrow key.
// Respond to the event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputRightArrow {
// Someone released the right arrow key.
// Respond to the event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
}

if didHandleEvent == false {
// If someone releases a key that you're not handling,
// pass the event to the next responder.
super.pressesEnded(presses, with: event)
}
}

# UIHoverGestureRecognizer

A continuous gesture recognizer that interprets pointer movement over a view.

@MainActor
class UIHoverGestureRecognizer

## Mentioned in

Optimizing your iPad app for Mac

## Overview

On macOS and iPadOS devices, a person can move the pointer over user interface elements. For some UI designs, it’s important to know when the pointer moves over an element, with no other user interactions, such as clicking the mouse button. The text for a hyperlink, for instance, may change colors or appear with an underline as the pointer moves over the link. This creates a rollover effect.

To provide this experience in your app, add a hover gesture recognizer that reacts as the pointer moves over the view. Provide the gesture recognizer with a `target` and `action` that the system calls when the pointer enters, exits, and moves across the view. `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` has no effect when your app runs in iOS. The following code changes the button’s default color to red as the pointer moves over the button.

class ViewController: UIViewController {

@IBOutlet var button: UIButton!

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

let hover = UIHoverGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(hovering(_:)))
button.addGestureRecognizer(hover)
}

@objc
func hovering(_ recognizer: UIHoverGestureRecognizer) {
switch recognizer.state {
case .began, .changed:
button.titleLabel?.textColor = #colorLiteral(red: 1, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 1)
case .ended:
button.titleLabel?.textColor = UIColor.link
default:
break
}
}
}

# Displaying a Preferences window

Provide a Preferences window in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst so users can manage app preferences defined in a Settings bundle.

## Overview

Mac apps typically display app-specific preferences using a Preferences window accessible through the standard Preferences menu item under the app menu in the menu bar.

Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst that include a `Settings.bundle` file automatically get the Preferences menu item and a Preferences window. When a user selects the Preferences menu item, the system displays a Mac-friendly Preferences window based on the options provided in your Settings bundle. To learn about Settings bundles, see Implementing an iOS Settings Bundle.

### Add a Preferences window to your app

To include a Preferences window in your Mac app, add a `Settings.bundle` file to your Xcode project by pressing Command-N and selecting the Settings Bundle template from the Resources section under iOS. Then click Next to save the file to your project.

### Add toolbar tabs to the Preferences window

A Settings bundle can include one or more child panes that allow you to organize your preferences hierarchically (see Hierarchical Preferences). In iOS, the Settings app displays a child pane as a preference row. When the user taps the row, the app displays a new view showing the preferences defined in the child pane’s property list file.

In macOS, the Preferences window displays a child pane as a tab on the window’s toolbar. When the user clicks the tab, they see the preferences provided in the child pane’s property list file.

The tab for a child pane displays the pane’s title and a system-provided icon. To customize the icon, add the following key to the child pane’s property list file:

`Icon`

Optional. A string with the name of the image file to display as the toolbar tab icon in the Preferences window.

You must include the image file in the Settings bundle that contains the child pane’s property list file.

### Confirm changes made with a toggle switch

Another element of the Settings bundle is the Toggle Switch Element, which displays an ON/OFF switch that the user can toggle. Your Mac app can prompt the user for a confirmation when they toggle the switch by including the following keys in the toggle switch element:

`TrueConfirmationPrompt`

Optional. A dictionary that defines the prompt to present to users when they attempt to turn on the switch.

`FalseConfirmationPrompt`

Optional. A dictionary that defines the prompt to present to users when they attempt to turn off the switch.

Each dictionary contains the following keys that define the contents of the prompt:

`Type`

Required. Must be set to `PSConfirmationPrompt`.

`Title`

Required. A string with the title of the prompt. The title might not appear on some devices.

`Prompt`

Required. A string with the body text that the prompt displays.

`ConfirmText`

Optional. A string with the text displayed in the prompt’s confirmation button. The toggle switch value changes when the user clicks this button.

`DenyText`

Optional. A string with the text displayed in the prompt’s cancel button. The toggle switch value doesn’t change when the user clicks this button.

### Display subtitles for toggle switches

Some iOS apps show descriptive text in a subtitle below a toggle switch using a group item with footer text. While the Preferences window supports this approach, the appearance on a Mac isn’t ideal. Instead, include the following key in the toggle switch element to show a subtitle:

`Description`

Optional. A longer descriptive string to display under a toggle switch.

# Detecting changes in the preferences window

Listen for and respond to a user’s preference changes in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst using Combine.

Download

Xcode 11.1+

## Overview

With Combine, your app can listen for changes a user makes to the app’s Preferences window, and respond to those changes. The sample app provides a Preferences window with one setting: background color. When the user selects a color, the background of the main view changes to match their selection.

This sample code project shows how to:

- Add a Preferences window in a Mac app built with Mac Catalyst.

- Register default values for the preferences.

- Retrieve current preference values.

- Listen for and respond to changes the user makes in the Preferences window.

To use the sample app, open the sample code project in Xcode and select My Mac as the destination. Then, build and run the sample project.

### Provide a preferences window in the app

The sample app includes a `Settings.bundle` file that the system uses to automatically add the standard Preferences menu item to the app menu. Selecting the menu item displays a Preferences window that the system generates based on the preference specifiers defined in the Settings bundle. To learn more, see Displaying a Preferences window.

The Settings bundle for the sample app has a preference specifier for setting the background color of the main view. It also has a child pane preference specifier, which displays a second tab of preferences in the Preferences windows. The Settings bundle file `Root.plist` defines these specifiers, while the file `OtherSettings.plist` defines the preference specifiers for the child pane.

### Register default preference values

When the user changes preferences in the Preferences window, the window saves them to the application domain of the user defaults system. To store and retrieve the preference values within the app, the sample app uses `UserDefaults`. However, when you launch the sample app for the first time, the preference values don’t exist in the user defaults system. If the app tries retrieving a value, `UserDefaults` returns `nil`.

To ensure that the app always retrieves a non- `nil` value, the sample app registers the default preference values with the registration domain. However, this domain doesn’t persist these values between app launches, so the sample app registers the default values each time the user launches the app.

// To ensure that the app has a good set of preference values, register
// the default values each time the app launches.
registerDefaultPreferenceValues()

return true
}

The method `registerDefaultPreferenceValues()` retrieves the default values from the Settings bundle by retrieving the preference specifiers from the `Root.plist` file and parsing the specifiers for their default value. After retrieving the values, the method registers the default values.

func registerDefaultPreferenceValues() {
let preferenceSpecifiers = retrieveSettingsBundlePreferenceSpecifiers(from: "Root.plist")
let defaultValuesToRegister = parse(preferenceSpecifiers)

// Register the default values with the registration domain.
UserDefaults.standard.register(defaults: defaultValuesToRegister)
}

To parse the preference specifiers, the `parse()` method loops through the array of specifiers, copying the default values into the dictionary `defaultValuesToRegister`. If the method detects the `PSChildPaneSpecifier` type, it gets the name of the child pane property list file, and merges the default values in the file into the `defaultValuesToRegister` dictionary. After gathering the default values, the method returns the dictionary to the caller.

var defaultValuesToRegister = String: Any

// Parse the preference specifiers, copying the default values
// into the `defaultValuesToRegister` dictionary.
for preferenceItem in preferenceSpecifiers {
if let key = preferenceItem["Key"] as? String,
let defaultValue = preferenceItem["DefaultValue"] {
defaultValuesToRegister[key] = defaultValue
}

// Add child pane preference specifiers.
if let type = preferenceItem["Type"] as? String,
type == "PSChildPaneSpecifier" {
if var file = preferenceItem["File"] as? String {
if file.hasSuffix(".plist") == false {
file += ".plist"
}
let morePreferenceSpecifiers = retrieveSettingsBundlePreferenceSpecifiers(from: file)
let moreDefaultValuesToRegister = parse(morePreferenceSpecifiers)
defaultValuesToRegister.merge(moreDefaultValuesToRegister) { (current, _) in current }
}
}
}

return defaultValuesToRegister
}

### Retrieve preference values

After registering the default values with the registration domain, the app can retrieve a preference value without the possibility of encountering an unavailable value. To simplify access to the background color preference value, the sample app extends `UserDefaults` to include properties for each preference value.

extension UserDefaults {

@objc dynamic var backgroundColorValue: Int {
return integer(forKey: "backgroundColorValue")
}

@objc dynamic var someRandomOption: Bool {
return bool(forKey: "someRandomOption")
}

}

### Handle changes made in the preferences window

As the user changes the background color setting in the Preferences window, the app changes the background color of its main view. To accomplish this, the view controller for the main view creates a subscriber in the `viewDidLoad()` method. When the background color value changes, the subscriber receives the new value, maps it to a `UIColor` object, and assigns the color to the view’s `backgroundColor` property.

var subscriber: AnyCancellable? // Subscriber of preference changes.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

// Set the view's initial background color to the color specified in Preferences.
if let colorSetting = BackgroundColors(rawValue: UserDefaults.standard.backgroundColorValue) {
view.backgroundColor = colorSetting.currentColor()
}

// Listen for changes to the background color preference made in the Preferences window.
subscriber = UserDefaults.standard
.publisher(for: \.backgroundColorValue, options: [.initial, .new])
.map( { BackgroundColors(rawValue: $0)?.currentColor() })
.assign(to: \UIView.backgroundColor, on: self.view)
}

Sample Code

# Showing help tags for views and controls using tooltip interactions

Explain the purpose of interface elements by showing a tooltip when a person positions the pointer over the element.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

This sample shows how to display a tooltip (also known as a _help tag_) that explains the purpose of, or provide additional information about, an interface element such as a view or control without shifting a person’s focus away from the primary interface. A tooltip appears when a person positions the pointer over a view or control for a few seconds. The tooltip remains visible for a few seconds or until the pointer moves away from the interface element.

For guidelines on designing the content of your tooltips, see the Help section of the macOS Human Interface Guidelines.

### Configure the sample code project

Tooltips are available in the sample app when running in macOS 12 or later. To build and run the sample app:

### Add a tooltip to a view

To show a tooltip when the pointer hovers over a view, the sample creates a `UIToolTipInteraction` object and passes in the default tooltip text. Then the sample adds the interaction to a `UIView` using the view’s `addInteraction(_:)` method.

lazy var viewWithDefaultTooltip: UIView = {
let view = UIView()
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemGreen
view.addText("Hover the pointer over this view to see its default tooltip.")

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction(defaultToolTip: "The default tooltip for the view.")
view.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

return view
}()

The sample uses the same approach for other types of views too, for instance, to add a tooltip to an instance of `UILabel`:

lazy var labelWithTooltip: UILabel = {
let label = UILabel()
label.text = "Hover the pointer over this label to see its tooltip."
label.numberOfLines = 0

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction(defaultToolTip: "The label's tooltip.")
label.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

return label
}()

### Add a tooltip to a control

For interface elements that derive from `UIControl`, such as `UIButton`, the sample uses the `toolTip` property to set the default text that appears in the tooltip instead of adding an interaction to the control.

lazy var buttonWithTooltip: UIButton = {
var configuration = UIButton.Configuration.filled()
configuration.title = "Buy"
configuration.subtitle = "Only $9.99"
configuration.titleAlignment = .center

let action = UIAction { _ in print("Thank you for your purchase.") }

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to buy this item. You'll have a chance to change your mind before confirming your purchase."
button.preferredBehavioralStyle = .pad

return button
}()

### Change the tooltip text of a view

Setting the `defaultToolTip` property of a tooltip interaction and setting the `toolTip` property of a control are convenient ways to show tooltip text that don’t change while the app runs. However, there may be times when an app needs to determine the contents of the tooltip based on the state of the app or logic specific to the app. For instance, the sample app looks up the name of a view’s background color and displays the name in a tooltip when the pointer hovers over that view.

To show the background color name in a tooltip, the sample creates an instance of `UIToolTipInteraction` and sets its `delegate` property to an instance of `ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip`, which is a custom view that conforms to the `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` protocol. Then the sample adds the interaction to the view.

lazy var viewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView = {
let view = ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip()
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemYellow
view.addText("Hover the pointer over this view to see the name of the view's background color.")

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction()
tooltipInteraction.delegate = view
view.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

Next, `ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip` implements the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method, and returns a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object that contains the name of the background color as the text of the tooltip. If the color name isn’t available, the method returns `nil`, which prevents the tooltip from displaying.

class ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

let configuration: UIToolTipConfiguration?
if let accessibilityName = backgroundColor?.accessibilityName {
configuration = UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "The color is \(accessibilityName).")
} else {
configuration = nil
}

return configuration
}

}

### Change the tooltip text of a control

To change the tooltip text of a control like the sample’s shopping cart button, the sample provides a tooltip interaction delegate as it did with the custom view. But instead of creating a tooltip interaction, it sets the button’s `toolTip` property to the default text. This causes the control to create a `UIToolTipInteraction` object and assign it to the `toolTipInteraction` property. The sample then uses the property to assign a delegate to the interaction.

lazy var shoppingCartButtonWithTooltip: UIButton = {
var configuration = UIButton.Configuration.filled()
configuration.title = "Add to Cart"
configuration.image = UIImage(systemName: "cart.circle")
configuration.imagePlacement = NSDirectionalRectEdge.leading
configuration.imagePadding = 4

let action = UIAction { [unowned self] _ in self.cartItemCount += 1 }

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart is empty."
button.toolTipInteraction?.delegate = self

The sample also implements the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` delegate method, which returns a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object that contains the tooltip text describing the purpose of the button and the number of items in the shopping cart.

let text: String
switch cartItemCount {
case 0:
text = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart is empty."
case 1:
text = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart contains \(cartItemCount) item."
default:
text = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart contains \(cartItemCount) items."
}

return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: text)
}

### Specify the hover region

In addition to setting the tooltip text in a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object, a delegate can specify the region of an interface element where the pointer must hover to trigger the display of the tooltip. The sample app, for example, shows a view that displays a tooltip after positioning the pointer over the top or bottom regions of the view, but not when the pointer is over the middle area.

To determine whether the pointer location is in the top or bottom region of the view, the sample uses the `point` value that the method `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` provides. When the pointer is in one of those regions, the delegate method returns a tooltip configuration that contains the tooltip text and the source rectangle, which defines the area of the view that the pointer must hover over to trigger the display of the tooltip.

class ViewWithTooltipRegion: UIView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

var topRect = self.bounds
var bottomRect = self.bounds

let partHeight = self.bounds.size.height / 3
topRect.size.height = partHeight
bottomRect.size.height = partHeight
bottomRect.origin.y = partHeight * 2

// Display the tooltip if the pointer within the top or bottom rects.
if topRect.contains(point) {
return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "Top area of the view.", in: topRect)
} else if bottomRect.contains(point) {
return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "Bottom area of the view.", in: bottomRect)
}

// Pointer is in the middle of the view; don't display a tooltip.

}

In another example, the sample uses the source rectangle of a tooltip configuration to specify the region of selected text in a text view. When hovering the pointer over the selected text, a tooltip appears but it doesn’t appear when the pointer hovers over unselected text.

class TextViewWithTooltip: UITextView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

guard
let selectedTextRange = self.selectedTextRange,
selectedTextRange.isEmpty == false
else {
return nil
}

var unionedRect = firstRect(for: selectedTextRange)
for selectionRect in selectionRects(for: selectedTextRange) {
unionedRect = unionedRect.union(selectionRect.rect)
}

if let selectedText = text(in: selectedTextRange) {
return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "Selected text: \(selectedText)", in: unionedRect)
}

return nil
}

# UIToolTipInteraction

An interaction object that makes it possible to show a tooltip when hovering a pointer over a view or control.

@MainActor
class UIToolTipInteraction

## Overview

To show a tooltip when the pointer hovers over a view, add a `UIToolTipInteraction` object to the view. For example, the following code listings shows how to add a tooltip to a label:

let label = UILabel()
label.text = "Label with a tooltip"

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction(defaultToolTip: "The label's tooltip.")
label.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

If you want your app to determine the tooltip text at a later time — for instance, to reflect the current state of your app — set the interaction’s `delegate` property to an object that conforms to the `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` protocol.

To add a tooltip to a control derived from `UIControl`, use the convenience property `toolTip`; for example, to add a tooltip to the button:

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to buy this item. You'll have a chance to change your mind before confirming your purchase."

Setting the `toolTip` property creates a tooltip interaction for the control, which you can retrieve from the `toolTipInteraction` property.

# UIToolTipInteractionDelegate

An interface that provides tooltip settings to an interaction.

@MainActor
protocol UIToolTipInteractionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

A tooltip interaction delegate provides configuration information about a tooltip. You can, for instance, use the delegate to change the text of a tooltip.

To change the tooltip text, set a tooltip interaction’s `delegate` property to an object that conforms to the `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` protocol and implements the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method. For example, in the following code listing, the code creates a new view and assigns its background color. Then the code creates a `UIToolTipInteraction` object, sets the `delegate` equal to the view, and adds the interaction to the view.

lazy var viewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView = {
let view = ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip()
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemYellow

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction()
tooltipInteraction.delegate = view
view.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

return view
}()

The delegate’s implementation of the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method looks up the `accessibilityName` of the view’s background color. If the name is available, the method creates a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object, passing in the name of the color. Then the method returns the configuration. If the name isn’t available, the method returns `nil`, which prevents the display of the tooltip.

class ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

let configuration: UIToolTipConfiguration?
if let accessibilityName = backgroundColor?.accessibilityName {
configuration = UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "The color is \(accessibilityName).")
} else {
configuration = nil
}

return configuration
}

}

In addition to changing the tooltip text, you can also specify the region within a view or control where a person must position the pointer to trigger the display of the tooltip. To specify the region, create the tooltip configuration using the `init(toolTip:in:)` method.

# Customizing the behavior of segue-based presentations

Pass data between view controllers during a segue, and programmatically control when segues occur.

## Overview

When the user triggers a segue, UIKit presents the view controller using the options found in your storyboard. UIKit also provides opportunities for you to modify the segue process dynamically, either by preventing the segue from occurring or by doing extra work when a segue occurs.

For information on how to create a segue, see Specify presentations visually in your storyboard file.

### Configure the presentation style of the transition

The segue’s type determines what kind of animations UIKit uses when presenting and dismissing the segue, as the table below shows. You specify the type when you create the segue, but you can also change it in the attributes inspector later.

| Segue type | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Show (Push) | Displays the view controller modally unless a parent view controller implements the `show(_:sender:)` action method, in which case that view controller defines the presentation behavior. For example, a `UINavigationController` pushes the new view controller onto its navigation stack. |
| Show Detail (Replace) | Displays the view controller modally unless a parent view controller implements the `showDetailViewController(_:sender:)` action method, in which case that view controller defines the presentation behavior. For example, a `UISplitViewController` replaces its second child view controller (the detail controller) with the new view controller. |
| Present Modally | Displays the view controller modally using the specified presentation and transition styles. |
| Present as Popover | In a horizontally regular environment, UIKit presents the view controller in a popover. In a horizontally compact environment, UIKit presents the view controller modally. |

For more information about how UIKit performs segues involving the Show and Show Detail presentation styles, see Let the current context define the presentation technique.

### Prevent a segue based on dynamic conditions

When you don’t want the user to leave the current view controller, tell UIKit not to perform a segue by returning false from the `shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)` method of the source view controller. Use that method to perform any checks you need to determine whether the segue can proceed. For example, return `false` if the view controller’s content is invalid and requires corrective user actions. Returning true lets the segue continue, but returning `false` causes the segue to fail silently.

### Pass data to the presented view controller

Because UIKit creates and presents the view controller automatically during a segue, use the `prepare(for:sender:)` method to pass any data to that view controller before the segue occurs. Implement the method on the view controller containing the object that initiated the segue. Fetch the new view controller from the provided `UIStoryboardSegue` object, along with information about which segue was triggered.

In the following code example, the current view controller fetches the image associated with the selected table row and passes that image to the new view controller.

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
// Get the new view controller.
if let imageVC = segue.destination as? ImageViewController {

// Fetch the image for the selected row.
let image = getImageForSelectedRow()
imageVC.currentImage = image
}
}

Use the delegate design pattern to pass data from a presented view controller ) method.

### Understand the sequence of events during a segue

Although UIKit handles segues automatically, there are many places where you can perform work related to displaying the new view controller. The following figure shows the flow of events that happens from the time the user triggers a segue until the process is complete. The main place to perform perform segue-related actions is the current view controller’s `prepare(for:sender:)` method, but you also may perform tasks during the creation of the new view controller.

## Mentioned in

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

## Overview

A `UIStoryboard` object manages archived versions of your app’s view controllers. At design time, you configure the content of your view controllers visually, and Xcode saves the data needed to recreate that interface in a storyboard file in your app’s bundle. When you want to create a new view controller programmatically, first create a `UIStoryboard` object and specify the appropriate name and bundle information. Then use that object to instantiate the specific view controller that you want.

During the instantiation process, `UIStoryboard` creates your view controller programmatically using its doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/oslog/oslogentry/init(coder:) method. The storyboard passes the view controller’s data archive to that method, which then uses the data to recreate the state of the view controller and its views. If you have a custom initialization method for your view controller, you can ask the storyboard to instantiate your view controller using a block you provide. You can use this block to call your custom initialization method, passing any extra data your view controller needs.

For visionOS apps, you can load existing storyboards, but you can’t add content specific to the platform. Migrate your interface code to SwiftUI as soon as possible.

- UIKit
- UIImageAsset

Class

# UIImageAsset

A container for a collection of images that represent multiple ways of describing a single piece of artwork.

tvOS

class UIImageAsset

## Overview

A common use case for `UIImageAsset` is the grouping of multiple images of the same item at different display scales. Image asset objects aren’t assigned to instances of `UIImage` rather; `UIImage` provides an asset when multiple representations of an image are available. Images retrieved from image asset catalogs using the `init(named:)` or `init(named:in:compatibleWith:)` methods automatically have an image asset object that allows access to other images from the catalog.

### Register an image

When you register an image with an image asset, you associate a `UITraitCollection` object with the image. The trait collection must contain the `displayScale` and `userInterfaceIdiom` trait properties. If you don’t define these traits in the trait collection, the following defaults are assigned:

- `displayScale` = `1.0`

- `userInterfaceIdiom` = `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.unspecified`

For example, if you create a trait collection that only contains a horizontal size class, the default display scale and idiom are added when the image is registered.

### Retrieve an image

When you retrieve or unregister an image from an image asset, you do so using the trait collection that was used to register the image. To ensure the correct image is retrieved, the trait collection used must contain the `displayScale` and `userInterfaceIdiom` traits. If these traits aren’t defined in the trait collection, the following defaults are assigned:

- `displayScale` = scale of the current device

- `userInterfaceIdiom` = the type of interface used on the current device

For example, if you create a trait collection that only contains a horizontal size class, the default display scale and idiom of the current device are added when searching the `UIImageAsset` for an image.

`UIImageView` automatically retrieves the correct image when `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` is called on it.

## Topics

### Initializing an image asset

`init()`

Creates a new image asset object.

`init?(coder: NSCoder)`

Creates an image asset from data in an unarchiver.

### Registering and unregistering images

# NSDataAsset

An object from a data set type stored in an asset catalog.

class NSDataAsset

## Overview

The object’s content is stored as a set of one or more files with associated device attributes. These sets can also be tagged for use as on-demand resources.

### Initialize data assets

Data assets are initialized from a named data set in an asset catalog. You create data sets during app development. Each data set contains one or more data files. Each file has associated attributes for features of the device, including the minimum amount of memory and the version of Metal. When you initialize the data asset, the system selects the data file that best matches the current device.

For more information on the data set type in an asset catalog, see Data Set Type in Asset Catalog Format Reference. For information on asset catalogs, see Managing assets with asset catalogs.

### Access the data

You access the data file by using the `data` property. Because the property is of type `NSData` it provides methods for accessing the raw data only as bytes and ranges of bytes.

To access structured data, convert the bytes into the appropriate format. The system can convert some data types for you. One example is XML data using the `init(data:)` method of `XMLParser`. Other data types require code for parsing and converting the raw data. You may need to convert larger data files incrementally.

## Topics

### Initializing the data asset

`convenience init?(name: NSDataAssetName)`

Initializes and returns an object with a reference to the named data asset in an asset catalog.

`init?(name: NSDataAssetName, bundle: Bundle)`

Initializes and returns an object with a reference to the named data asset that’s in an asset catalog in the specified bundle.

### Accessing data

`var data: Data`

The raw data values in the data asset.

### Getting data asset information

`var name: NSDataAssetName`

The name of the data set in the asset catalog.

`typealias NSDataAssetName`

The name of a data asset.

`var typeIdentifier: String`

The uniform type identifier for the data asset.

Class

# UINib

An object that contains Interface Builder nib files.

tvOSvisionOS 1.0–1.0Deprecated

@MainActor
class UINib

## Overview

A `UINib` object caches the contents of a nib file in memory, ready for unarchiving and instantiation. When your app needs to instantiate the contents of the nib file, it can do so without having to load the data from the nib file first, which improves performance. The `UINib` object can automatically release this cached nib data to free up memory for your app under low-memory conditions, reloading that data the next time your app instantiates the nib.

Your app should use `UINib` objects whenever it needs to repeatedly instantiate the same nib data. For example, if your table view uses a nib file to instantiate table view cells, caching the nib in a `UINib` object can improve performance.

When you create a `UINib` object using the contents of a nib file, the object loads the object graph in the referenced nib file, but it doesn’t unarchive it yet. To unarchive all of the nib data and instantiate the nib, your app calls the `instantiate(withOwner:options:)` method. For more information about the steps that the `UINib` object follows to instantiate the nib’s object graph, see Resource Programming Guide.

## Topics

### Creating a nib object

`init(nibName: String, bundle: Bundle?)`

Class

# UIActivity

An abstract class that you subclass to implement app-specific services.

class UIActivity

## Mentioned in

Adding custom actions and activities

## Overview

You should subclass `UIActivity` only if you want to provide custom services to people. A service takes data that’s passed to it, does something to that data, and returns the results. For example, a social media service might take whatever text, images, or other content is provided to it and post them to a person’s account. Activity objects are used in conjunction with a `UIActivityViewController` object, which is responsible for presenting services to people.

The system already provides support for many standard services and makes them available through the `UIActivityViewController` object. For example, the standard activity view controller supports emailing data, posting items to one of a person’s social media accounts, and several other options. You don’t have to provide custom services for any of the built-in types.

### Subclassing notes

This class must be subclassed before it can be used. The job of an activity object is to act on the data provided to it and to provide some meta information that iOS can display to people. For more complex services, an activity object can also display a custom user interface and use it to gather additional information from people.

#### Methods to override

When subclassing, you must always override the following methods and use them to provide information about your service:

- `activityType`

- `activityTitle`

- `activityImage`

- `canPerform(withActivityItems:)`

- `prepare(withActivityItems:)`

- `activityCategory`

If your `canPerform(withActivityItems:)` method indicates that your subclass is able to operate on the specified data, the active `UIActivityViewController` object displays your service to people. When a person selects your service, the activity view controller calls the `prepare(withActivityItems:)` method followed by only one of these methods:

- `activityViewController` — Returns a view controller to present to a person. If your service requires additional input from a person, override this method and use it to return the view controller object responsible for presenting your custom UI. (You don’t need to present the view controller yourself.) After your view controller object gathers the needed input, it’s responsible for initiating the task associated with the service.

- `perform()` — Performs the service without displaying any additional UI. If your service doesn’t need additional input from a person, override this method and perform the task associated with the service.

Collaborating and sharing copies of your data

## Overview

The system provides several standard services, such as copying items to the pasteboard, posting content to social media sites, sending items via email or SMS, and more. Apps can also define custom services.

Your app is responsible for configuring, presenting, and dismissing this view controller. Configuration for the view controller involves specifying the data objects on which the view controller should act. (You can also specify the list of custom services your app supports.) When presenting the view controller, you must do so using the appropriate means for the current device. On iPad, you must present the view controller in a popover. On iPhone and iPod touch, you must present it modally.

protocol UIActivityItemSource : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

You can use this protocol in situations where you want to provide the data from one of your app’s existing objects instead of creating a separate `UIActivityItemProvider` object. When implementing this protocol, your object becomes the data provider, providing the view controller with access to the items.

Because the methods of this protocol are executed on your app’s main thread, you should avoid using this protocol in cases where the data objects might take a significant amount of time to create. When creating large data objects, consider using a `UIActivityItemProvider` object instead.

## Topics

### Getting the data items

class UIActivityItemProvider

## Overview

You can use a provider object in situations where you want to make data available for use by an activity but you want to delay providing that data until it’s actually needed. For example, you might use a provider object to represent a large video file that needs to be processed before it can be shared to a user’s social media account.

When you initialize a `UIActivityViewController` object, you can pass a provider object in addition to any other data objects. When the user selects an activity, the activity view controller adds your provider object (which is also an operation object) to an operation queue so that it can begin to gather or process the needed data.

### Subclassing notes

You must subclass `UIActivityItemProvider` and implement its `item` method, which is called to generate the item data. You implement this method instead of the normal `main()` method you’d implement for an operation object. (The `main()` method calls the `item` method when the operation object is executed.) Your implementation of the `item` method should do whatever work is necessary to create and return the data.

## Topics

## Mentioned in

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

Responding to memory warnings

Creating a custom container view controller

## Overview

The `UIViewController` class defines the shared behavior that’s common to all view controllers. You rarely create instances of the `UIViewController` class directly. Instead, you subclass `UIViewController` and add the methods and properties needed to manage the view controller’s view hierarchy.

A view controller’s main responsibilities include the following:

- Updating the contents of the views, usually in response to changes to the underlying data

- Responding to user interactions with views

- Resizing views and managing the layout of the overall interface

- Coordinating with other objects — including other view controllers — in your app

A view controller is tightly bound to the views it manages and takes part in handling events in its view hierarchy. Specifically, view controllers are `UIResponder` objects and are inserted into the responder chain between the view controller’s root view and that view’s superview, which typically belongs to a different view controller. If none of the view controller’s views handle an event, the view controller has the option of handling the event or passing it along to the superview.

View controllers are rarely used in isolation. Instead, you often use multiple view controllers, each of which owns a portion of your app’s user interface. For example, one view controller might display a table of items while a different view controller displays the selected item from that table. Usually, only the views from one view controller are visible at a time. A view controller may present a different view controller to display a new set of views, or it may act as a container for other view controllers’ content and animate views however it wants.

### Subclassing notes

Every app contains at least one custom subclass of `UIViewController`. More often, apps contain many custom view controllers. Custom view controllers define the overall behaviors of your app, including the app’s appearance and how it responds to user interactions. The following sections provide a brief overview of some of the tasks your custom subclass performs. For detailed information about using and implementing view controllers, see View Controller Programming Guide for iOS.

#### Manage views

Each view controller manages a view hierarchy, the root view of which is stored in the `view` property of this class. The root view acts primarily as a container for the rest of the view hierarchy. The size and position of the root view is determined by the object that owns it, which is either a parent view controller or the app’s window. The view controller that’s owned by the window is the app’s root view controller and its view is sized to fill the window.

View controllers load their views lazily. Accessing the `view` property for the first time loads or creates the view controller’s views. There are several ways to specify the views for a view controller:

- Specify the view controller and its views in your app’s storyboard. Storyboards are the preferred way to specify your views. With a storyboard, you specify the views and their connections to the view controller. You also specify the relationships and segues between your view controllers, which makes it easier to see and modify your app’s behavior.

To load a view controller from a storyboard, call the `instantiateViewController(withIdentifier:)` method of the appropriate `UIStoryboard` object. The storyboard object creates the view controller and returns it to your code.

- Specify the views for a view controller using a nib file. A nib file lets you specify the views of a single view controller but doesn’t let you define segues or relationships between view controllers. The nib file also stores only minimal information about the view controller itself.

To initialize a view controller object using a nib file, create your view controller class programmatically and initialize it using the `init(nibName:bundle:)` method. When its views are requested, the view controller loads them from the nib file.

- Specify the views for a view controller using the `loadView()` method. In that method, create your view hierarchy programmatically and assign the root view of that hierarchy to the view controller’s `view` property.

All of these techniques have the same end result, which is to create the appropriate set of views and expose them through the `view` property.

A view controller’s root view is always sized to fit its assigned space. For other views in your view hierarchy, use Interface Builder to specify the Auto Layout constraints that govern how each view is positioned and sized within its superview’s bounds. You can also create constraints programmatically and add them to your views at appropriate times. For more information about how to create constraints, see Auto Layout Guide.

##### Handle view-related notifications

When the visibility of its views changes, a view controller automatically calls its own methods so that subclasses can respond to the change. Use a method like `viewIsAppearing(_:)` to prepare your views to appear onscreen, and use `viewWillDisappear(_:)` to save changes or other state information. Use other methods to make appropriate changes.

The following image shows the possible visible states for a view controller’s views and the state transitions that can occur. Not all `will` callback methods are paired with only a `did` callback method. You need to ensure that if you start a process in a `will` callback method, you end the process in both the corresponding `did` and the opposite `will` callback method.

##### Handle view rotations

As of iOS 8, all rotation-related methods are deprecated. Instead, rotations are treated as a change in the size of the view controller’s view and are therefore reported using the `viewWillTransition(to:with:)` method. When the interface orientation changes, UIKit calls this method on the window’s root view controller. That view controller then notifies its child view controllers, propagating the message throughout the view controller hierarchy.

In iOS 6 and iOS 7, your app supports the interface orientations defined in your app’s `Info.plist` file. A view controller can override the `supportedInterfaceOrientations` method to limit the list of supported orientations. Typically, the system calls this method only on the root view controller of the window or a view controller presented to fill the entire screen; child view controllers use the portion of the window provided for them by their parent view controller and no longer participate directly in decisions about what rotations are supported. The intersection of the app’s orientation mask and the view controller’s orientation mask is used to determine which orientations a view controller can be rotated into.

You can override the `preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation` for a view controller that’s intended to be presented full screen in a specific orientation.

When a rotation occurs for a visible view controller, the `willRotate(to:duration:)`, `willAnimateRotation(to:duration:)`, and `didRotate(from:)` methods are called during the rotation. The `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` method is also called after the view is resized and positioned by its parent. If a view controller isn’t visible when an orientation change occurs, then the rotation methods are never called. However, the `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` method is called when the view becomes visible.

#### Implement a container view controller

A custom `UIViewController` subclass can also act as a container view controller. A container view controller manages the presentation of content of other view controllers it owns, also known as its child view controllers. A child’s view can be presented as-is or in conjunction with views owned by the container view controller.

Your container view controller subclass should declare a public interface to associate its children. The nature of these methods is up to you and depends on the semantics of the container you’re creating. You need to decide how many children can be displayed by your view controller at once, when those children are displayed, and where they appear in your view controller’s view hierarchy. Your view controller class defines what relationships, if any, are shared by the children. By establishing a clean public interface for your container, you ensure that children use its capabilities logically, without accessing too many private details about how your container implements the behavior.

Your container view controller must associate a child view controller with itself before adding the child’s root view to the view hierarchy. This allows iOS to properly route events to child view controllers and the views those controllers manage. Likewise, after it removes a child’s root view from its view hierarchy, it should disconnect that child view controller from itself. To make or break these associations, your container calls specific methods defined by the base class. These methods aren’t intended to be called by clients of your container class; they are to be used only by your container’s implementation to provide the expected containment behavior.

Here are the essential methods you might need to call:

- `addChild(_:)`

- `removeFromParent()`

- `willMove(toParent:)`

- `didMove(toParent:)`

#### Manage memory

Memory is a critical resource in iOS, and view controllers provide built-in support for reducing their memory footprint at critical times. The `UIViewController` class provides some automatic handling of low-memory conditions through its `didReceiveMemoryWarning()` method, which releases unneeded memory.

#### Support state preservation and restoration

If you assign a value to the view controller’s `restorationIdentifier` property, the system may ask the view controller to encode itself when the app transitions to the background. When preserved, a view controller preserves the state of any views in its view hierarchy that also have restoration identifiers. View controllers don’t automatically save any other state. If you’re implementing a custom container view controller, you must encode any child view controllers yourself. Each child you encode must have a unique restoration identifier.

For more information about how the system determines which view controllers to preserve and restore, see App Programming Guide for iOS. To see an example of state preservation and restoration, see Restoring your app’s state.

Protocol

# UITraitEnvironment

A set of methods that makes the iOS interface environment available to your app.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UITraitEnvironment : NSObjectProtocol

## Mentioned in

Checking the availability of 3D Touch

## Overview

The iOS interface environment includes traits such as horizontal and vertical size class, display scale, and user interface idiom. To access the trait environment of an object that adopts this protocol, use the `traitCollection` property. The protocol also provides an overridable method that the system calls when the interface environment changes. Implement this method as part of creating an adaptive iOS app.

For more about trait collections, see `UITraitCollection`. For the WWDC 2014 presentation on creating adaptive interfaces in iOS, see Building Adaptive Apps with UIKit.

## Topics

### Accessing a trait collection

`var traitCollection: UITraitCollection`

The traits, such as the size class and scale factor, that describe the current environment of the object.

# Managing your app’s life cycle

Respond to system notifications when your app is in the foreground or background, and handle other significant system-related events.

## Overview

The current state of your app determines what it can and can’t do at any time. For example, a foreground app has someone’s attention, so it has priority over system resources, including the CPU. By contrast, a background app must do as little work as possible, and preferably nothing, because it’s offscreen. As your app changes from state to state, you must adjust its behavior accordingly.

When your app’s state changes, UIKit notifies you by calling methods of the appropriate delegate object:

- In iOS 13 and later, use `UISceneDelegate` objects to respond to life-cycle events.

- In iOS 12 and earlier, use the `UIApplicationDelegate` object to respond to life-cycle events.

### Respond to scene-based life-cycle events

UIKit delivers separate life-cycle events for each scene. A scene represents one instance of your app’s UI running on a device. A person can create multiple scenes for each app, and show and hide them separately. Because each scene has its own life cycle, each can be in a different state of execution. For example, one scene might be in the foreground while others are in the background or are suspended.

The following figure shows the state transitions for scenes. When a person or the system requests a new scene for your app, UIKit creates it and puts it in the unattached state. Person-requested scenes move quickly to the foreground, where they appear onscreen. A system-requested scene typically moves to the background so that it can process an event. For example, the system might launch the scene in the background to process a location event. When someone dismisses your app’s UI, UIKit moves the associated scene to the background state and eventually to the suspended state. UIKit can disconnect a background or suspended scene at any time to reclaim its resources, returning that scene to the unattached state.

Use scene transitions to perform the following tasks:

- When UIKit connects a scene to your app, configure your scene’s initial UI and load the data your scene needs.

- When transitioning to the foreground-active state, configure your UI and prepare to interact with a person. See Preparing your UI to run in the foreground.

- Upon leaving the foreground-active state, save data and quiet your app’s behavior. See Preparing your UI to run in the background.

- Upon entering the background state, finish crucial tasks, free up as much memory as possible, and prepare for your app snapshot. See Preparing your UI to run in the background.

- At scene disconnection, clean up any shared resources associated with the scene.

- In addition to scene-related events, you must also respond to the launch of your app using your `UIApplicationDelegate` object. For information about what to do at app launch, see Responding to the launch of your app.

### Respond to app-based life-cycle events

In iOS 12 and earlier, UIKit delivers all life-cycle events to the `UIApplicationDelegate` object. The app delegate manages all of your app’s windows, including those displayed on separate screens. As a result, app state transitions affect your app’s entire UI, including content on external displays.

The following figure shows the state transitions involving the app delegate object. After launch, the system puts the app in the inactive or background state, depending on whether the UI is about to appear onscreen. When launching to the foreground, the system transitions the app to the active state automatically. After that, the state fluctuates between active and background until the app terminates.

Use app transitions to perform the following tasks:

- At launch, initialize your app’s data structures and UI. See Responding to the launch of your app.

- At activation, finish configuring your UI and prepare to interact with a person. See Preparing your UI to run in the foreground.

- Upon deactivation, save data and quiet your app’s behavior. See Preparing your UI to run in the background.

- At termination, stop all work immediately and release any shared resources. See `applicationWillTerminate(_:)`.

### Respond to other significant events

In addition to handling life-cycle events, apps must also be prepared to handle the events listed in the following table. Use your `UIApplicationDelegate` object to handle most of these events. In some cases, you may also be able to handle them using notifications, allowing you to respond from other parts of your app.

| Event | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Memory warnings | Received when your app’s memory usage is too high. Reduce the amount of memory your app uses; see Responding to memory warnings. |
| Protected data becomes available/unavailable | Received when someone locks or unlocks their device. See `applicationProtectedDataDidBecomeAvailable(_:)` and `applicationProtectedDataWillBecomeUnavailable(_:)`. |
| Handoff tasks | Received when an `NSUserActivity` object needs to be processed. See `application(_:didUpdate:)`. |
| Time changes | Received for several different time changes, such as when the phone carrier sends a time update. See `applicationSignificantTimeChange(_:)`. |
| Open URLs | Received when your app needs to open a resource. See `application(_:open:options:)`. |

# Scenes

Manage multiple instances of your app’s UI simultaneously, and direct resources to the appropriate instance of your UI.

## Overview

UIKit manages each instance of your app’s UI using a `UIWindowScene` object. A _scene_ contains the windows and view controllers for presenting one instance of your UI. Each scene also has a corresponding `UIWindowSceneDelegate` object, which you use to coordinate interactions between UIKit and your app. Scenes run concurrently with each other, sharing the same memory and app process space. As a result, a single app may have multiple scenes and scene delegate objects active at the same time.

Manage the configuration of new scenes from your `UIApplicationDelegate` object.

# UIDevice

A representation of the current device.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIDevice

## Overview

Use a `UIDevice` object to get information about the device such as assigned name, device model, and operating-system name and version. You also use the `UIDevice` instance to detect changes in the device’s characteristics, such as physical orientation. You get the current orientation using the `orientation` property or receive change notifications by registering for the `orientationDidChangeNotification` notification. Before using either of these techniques to get orientation data, you must enable data delivery using the `beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications()` method. When you no longer need to track the device orientation, call the `endGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications()` method to disable the delivery of notifications.

Similarly, you can use the `UIDevice` instance to obtain information and notifications about changes to the battery’s charge state (described by the `batteryState` property) and charge level (described by the `batteryLevel` property). The `UIDevice` instance also provides access to the proximity sensor state (described by the `proximityState` property). The proximity sensor detects whether the user is holding the device close to their face. Enable battery monitoring or proximity sensing only when you need it.

You can also use the `playInputClick()` instance method to play keyboard input clicks in custom input and keyboard accessory views.

# Automatic trait tracking

Reduce the need to manually register for trait changes when you use traits within a method or closure that supports automatic trait tracking.

## Overview

Automatic trait tracking is a UIKit feature that eliminates the need to manually register for trait changes when you use traits in a supported method or closure. This feature reduces the amount of code you need to write and maintain, improves performance, and encourages the best practice of using traits within the scope of the supported APIs.

Some properties aren’t appropriate to change during `layoutSubviews()`, for example, properties where setting the value has a side-effect of invalidating the view’s layout. Update these properties in a view’s `updateProperties()` method, or a view controller’s `updateProperties()` method. These methods support automatic trait tracking, and automatic observation tracking on objects that use the `Observable()` macro. Notify an object of other updates to its properties by calling `setNeedsUpdateProperties()` on your view, or `setNeedsUpdateProperties()` on your view controller. Force an object to immediately update its properties by calling `updatePropertiesIfNeeded()` on your view, or `updatePropertiesIfNeeded()` on your view controller.

A complete list of APIs that support automatic trait tracking appears below.

## Topics

### Views

class UITraitCollection

## Mentioned in

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

The `traitCollection` property of the `UITraitEnvironment` protocol contains traits that describe the state of various elements of the iOS user interface, such as size class, display scale, and layout direction. Together, these traits compose the UIKit trait environment.

The following classes adopt `UITraitEnvironment`: `UIScreen`, `UIWindow`, `UIViewController`, `UIPresentationController`, and `UIView`. To create an adaptive interface, write code to adjust your app’s layout according to changes in these traits. You access specific trait values using the `UITraitCollection` `horizontalSizeClass`, `verticalSizeClass`, `displayScale`, and `userInterfaceIdiom` properties. The `UIUserInterfaceSizeClass` enumeration defines the values for the horizontal and vertical size class. The display scale is a floating point number. The `UIUserInterfaceIdiom` enumeration defines the values for the user interface idiom.

To make your view controllers and views responsive to changes in the iOS interface environment, override the `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` method from the trait environment protocol. To customize view controller animations in response to interface environment changes, override the `willTransition(to:with:)` method of the `UIContentContainer` protocol.

The following image shows the horizontal (width) and vertical (height) size classes your app can encounter when running full-screen on various devices.

For information about size classes your app encounters in Slide Over and Split View on iPad, read Slide Over and Split View Quick Start in Adopting Multitasking Enhancements on iPad.

You can create standalone trait collections to assist in matching against specific environments. The `UITraitCollection` class includes four specialized constructors, as well as a constructor that enables you to combine an array of trait collections, `init(traitsFrom:)`.

One important use of standalone trait collections is to enable conditional use of images based on the current iOS interface environment. You can associate a trait collection with a `UIImage` instance by way of a `UIImageAsset` instance, as described in the overview section of `UIImageAsset`. For information on configuring asset catalogs graphically from within the Xcode IDE, see Managing assets with asset catalogs.

You can employ a standalone trait collection to enable a two-column split view in landscape orientation on iPhone. See the `setOverrideTraitCollection(_:forChild:)` method of the `UIViewController` class.

You can also use a standalone trait collection to customize view appearance with the `appearance(for:)` protocol method, as described in `UIAppearance`.

### 3D Touch and trait collections

Starting in iOS 9, you can use this class to check whether the device on which your app is running supports 3D Touch. Read the value of the `forceTouchCapability` property on the trait collection for any object in your app with a trait environment. For information about trait environments, see `UITraitEnvironment`. For the possible values of the force touch capability property, see the `UIForceTouchCapability` enumeration.

Because a user can turn off 3D Touch in Settings, check the value of the `forceTouchCapability` property in your implementation of the `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` method, and adjust your code paths according to the property’s value.

### Custom traits

You can create a custom trait using `UITraitDefinition`. You read custom traits from `UITraitCollection` using subscript syntax. When you define a custom trait, declare a property for the trait in an extension to `UITraitCollection` so that you can access your custom trait using standard property syntax.

The following example defines a property for a custom trait, and reads the trait value from a trait collection.

// ThemeTrait conforms to UITraitDefinition, with a defaultValue type of Theme.
extension UITraitCollection {
var theme: Theme {
self[ThemeTrait.self]
}
}

let viewTheme = view.traitCollection.theme

Mac CatalystvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UITraitChangeObservable

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

Types that conform to `UITraitChangeObservable` can execute your code in response to changes in their trait collection. When you register for trait changes, the system observes the specified traits, and calls your code when any of the observed traits change value.

Keep your trait registrations focused, and avoid doing work not directly relevant to updated traits. Traits may change more than once before the system updates a view, so avoid expensive work in response to trait changes. For example, use the trait change notification to call `setNeedsDisplay()`, and update your view in `draw(_:)`.

UIKit cleans up registrations at the end of the object lifecycle. Unregister only in the rare situations when you need to dynamically change which traits you observe.

## Topics

### Observing trait changes

Registers a list of traits to observe, and calls a method on the receiving object when one of the observed traits changes.

**Required**

Registers a list of traits to observe and a closure to execute when one of the observed traits changes.

Protocol

# UITraitDefinition

A type representing a trait in a trait collection.

Mac CatalystvisionOS

protocol UITraitDefinition

## Overview

All traits contained in a `UITraitCollection` conform to this protocol. You can create custom traits by defining your own conforming type.

The example below defines a new trait that holds the value of an integer-based enumeration named `Theme`:

enum Theme: Int {
case standard
case monochrome
}

struct ThemeTrait: UITraitDefinition {
static let defaultValue = Theme.standard
}

The protocol defines default implementations for `name` and `identifier` properties. Defining `defaultValue` is the minimum requirement to conform to this protocol. All properties you implement must be constant. `UITraitDefinition` defines the associated type `Value` which is the type of `defaultValue`.

The best candidates for trait values are simple value types, such as `Bool`, `Int`, `Double`, and enumerations with an `Int` raw value. You can also use lightweight structures as trait values. The system frequently tests trait values for equality, so structures need an efficient implementation of `Equatable`. Avoid using Swift classes as trait values.

If you use your custom trait to implement custom dynamic colors, implement `affectsColorAppearance` and return `true`. Returning `true` tells the system to update and redraw views automatically when the trait changes. The system responds to changes to your trait similar to changes in system traits contained in `systemTraitsAffectingColorAppearance`. Changes to traits that affect color appearance are more expensive, so opt in to this behavior only when necessary, and change such traits infrequently.

For each custom trait, define extensions on `UIMutableTraits` and `UITraitCollection` to enable reading and modifying your custom traits with standard property syntax. The example below shows extensions for the example `Theme` trait.

extension UITraitCollection {
var theme: Theme { self[ThemeTrait.self] }
}

extension UIMutableTraits {
var theme: Theme {
get { self[ThemeTrait.self] }
set { self[ThemeTrait.self] = newValue }
}
}

A trait type serves as a unique key, identifying a trait within a trait collection. Methods such as `subscript(_:)` and `UIPresentationController/registerForTraitChanges(_:handler:)` take a trait type to identify the trait in a collection.

Traits defined in Swift aren’t automatically bridged to Objective-C. If you need to access your custom trait from both Swift and Objective-C code, define the trait in both languages. For details, see the Objective-C documentation for `UITraitDefinition`.

# Building a desktop-class iPad app

Optimize your iPad app’s user experience by adopting desktop-class enhancements for multitasking with Stage Manager, document interactions, text editing, search, and more.

## Overview

People can use an iPad with a Magic Keyboard and an external display to achieve desktop-class productivity. Build your app to take advantage of features that help people increase their efficiency, customize their workflows, and complete tasks more quickly. After you create a desktop-class iPad app, bring your app directly over to the Mac with minimal additional effort using Mac Catalyst. Bring your app to Apple Vision Pro using the details in Making your existing app compatible with visionOS.

### Enhance the multitasking experience with Stage Manager

A great iPad app supports productivity by enabling quick, complex workflows across multiple apps with Stage Manager, which people can use to quickly switch to other open apps and windows on the side of the screen. People can also dynamically resize app windows to show many open windows side by side on the iPad or on an external display.

Follow these steps to support a great multitasking experience with Stage Manager:

- Build your UI with scenes. A scene contains the windows and view controllers for presenting one instance of your UI. Adopt scenes as part of your app’s core infrastructure, and use them to adjust your app’s behavior at important times, such as when your scene transitions to the foreground, changes orientation, or moves to an external display. Use scenes, instead of `UIScreen`, to determine which hardware display shows your UI. For more information, see Scenes.

- Support a variety of workflows with multiple app windows. Consider letting people view and interact with more than one app window at a time to enable workflows like viewing multiple documents simultaneously or quickly dragging and dropping content from one part of your app to another. Use scenes to support multiple app windows. For more information, see Supporting multiple windows on iPad.

- Respond to window resizing. Because people who use Stage Manager can dynamically resize their iPad app windows, your app’s UI can transition through a broad range of sizes. Design your UI for flexible layout configurations, and make sure your app adapts to different window sizes quickly and smoothly. Discover your app’s environment with `UITraitCollection`, and adapt to it by using Auto Layout or by registering for trait change notifications in your view controllers or views with `UITraitChangeObservable` in Swift or `UITraitChangeRegistration` in Objective-C.

- Consider the best use of additional space that an external display provides. Support interactive resizable windows through scenes with a `windowApplication` role, or present noninteractive content with a `windowExternalDisplayNonInteractive` scene. For more information, see Presenting content on a connected display.

- Test your UI on different devices, in different environments. Consider the various configurations and sizes your UI can appear in, and make sure to test your app under those conditions. For example, test under the following conditions: full screen, Split View, Slide Over, Picture in Picture (PIP), and dynamic resizing in all dimensions while using Stage Manager with an external display.

### Support powerful document-editing workflows

Navigation-based apps support a specialized editor style that brings important document-editing features to the forefront and supports user customization. Navigation-based apps can also use a title menu to surface document management operations, sharing capabilities, and custom actions.

Follow these steps to support document-editing enhancements on iPad:

- Switch to editor-style navigation for document-editing apps. Navigation-based interfaces can use the `UINavigationItem.ItemStyle.editor` style to bring the content density and flexibility of the Mac toolbar to iPad. This style moves the title to the leading side to open up more space for important controls, so you can provide fast access to common actions with a single tap. Specify important controls using `centerItemGroups`, and enable people to customize the layout of those controls using `customizationIdentifier`.

- Support document interactions through a title menu. Show a menu when a person taps the document’s title using `titleMenuProvider`. Include standard actions like move, duplicate, and export, or implement custom actions. Add a menu header that contains document information and sharing capabilities, like share and drag and drop, using `documentProperties`.

- Support fast document renaming. Implement `renameDelegate` to show Rename in the title menu, and to surface an inline system UI for people to rename their document after tapping on the document’s title.

### Simplify the text-editing process

When people use an iPad with an external keyboard, they expect full support for keyboard input, including familiar keyboard shortcuts and interactions. A smooth text-editing experience takes advantage of standard system capabilities, and tailors itself according to touch or keyboard input. To enable a productive text-editing experience, leverage system enhancements to text-editing menus, as well as Find and Replace.

Follow these steps to provide a great text-editing experience on iPad:

- Create text-editing menus for the current input method. To create an edit menu that adjusts its presentation style according to touch or indirect input for an optimal user experience, see `UIEditMenuInteraction`.

- Integrate the system Find and Replace experience into your text views. For standard system text input views like `UITextView` or `WKWebView`, set `isFindInteractionEnabled` to `true` to allow people to find and replace text using the system Find panel. For custom text view implementations, see `UIFindInteraction`.

### Support inline searches with suggestions

iPadOS includes an inline search UI that opens up more space for the surrounding content. Improve content discovery by taking advantage of search capabilities in your iPad app and providing search suggestions to help people navigate your content even quicker.

Follow these steps to provide a great search experience on iPad:

- Choose the search experience that’s best for your UI. Take advantage of the inline search placement in a navigation bar to open up more space for your content. To control the search placement explicitly, set `preferredSearchBarPlacement` to choose between the inline or traditional stacked search experience.

- Provide helpful search suggestions. Specify `searchSuggestions` on your navigation item’s search controller to help people quickly narrow down their search. Update the search suggestions as people type. If you use a search field independently of a search controller, provide search suggestions using `searchSuggestions`.

### Provide an intuitive multiple-selection experience

People who use iPad with a Magic Keyboard expect to use the trackpad to perform different types of selections and actions in your app. Leverage multiple selection to provide intuitive interactions and elevate the most relevant contextual actions.

Follow these steps to provide a great experience for multiple selection on iPad:

- Enable lightweight multiple selection with indirect input. Allow people using indirect input methods, like a keyboard or trackpad, to select multiple items in a collection view without placing the collection view into editing mode. Opt into this behavior by setting `allowsMultipleSelection`, `allowsFocus`, and `selectionFollowsFocus` to `true`.

- Distinguish between selection and primary action. Primary actions allow you to distinguish between a distinct user action and a change in selection. A primary action occurs when a person selects a single cell without extending an existing selection. Implement `collectionView(_:performPrimaryActionForItemAt:)` to perform actions like navigation or showing another split-view column.

- Specialize context menu options according to the number of selected items. Customize your context menus to surface different capabilities depending on whether the selection contains zero, one, or many items. Implement `collectionView(_:contextMenuConfigurationForItemsAt:point:)` to support context menus for multiple selections in a collection view. If you use `UIContextMenuInteraction` directly, implement `secondaryItemIdentifiers` and the `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate` preview animation methods.

### Bring your iPad app to the Mac with Mac Catalyst

If your iPad app already supports a desktop-class experience, you can bring your app over to the Mac using Mac Catalyst. When you build your iPadOS app with Mac Catalyst, the system bridges certain interactions and UI elements to their counterparts in macOS.

Follow these steps to expedite the process of bringing your iPad app to the Mac with Mac Catalyst:

- Bring your navigation bar customization to the Mac toolbar. By default, `NSToolbar` automatically hosts your navigation bar’s content when its behavioral style is `UIBehavioralStyle.mac`. Use `behavioralStyle` to check your navigation bar’s behavioral style, and `currentNSToolbarSection` to check where the toolbar hosts the navigation bar. You can opt out of `NSToolbar` hosting your navigation bar by setting `preferredBehavioralStyle` to `UIBehavioralStyle.pad`.

- Host custom views directly in the Mac toolbar. If you build your own `NSToolbar` instead of using `UINavigationBar`, host your custom UIKit views in the toolbar by creating a `NSUIViewToolbarItem`. In your custom view, use the `toolbarItemPresentationSize` trait to render your content at an appropriate size depending on the toolbar’s display mode.

# Elevating your iPad app with a tab bar and sidebar

Provide a compact, ergonomic tab bar for quick access to key parts of your app, and a sidebar for in-depth navigation.

## Overview

In iPadOS 18 and later, the position of the tab bar moves from the bottom of the screen to float over your content at the top. This compact appearance gives you more space for your app’s content. Additionally, because it shares space with the navigation bar, it places your tabs closer to your app’s other controls.

iPadOS apps automatically receive the new tab bar appearance when you compile them for iPadOS 18 and later.

### Create a tab bar

iPadOS 18 also introduces new API for creating tab bars. Create a `UITabBarController` and assign an array of `UITab` objects to its `tabs` property. To create a tab, call `init(title:image:identifier:viewControllerProvider:)`. In the closure, return the view controller your app presents when someone selects the tab. If you use SF Symbols for your tab’s image, be sure to select the outline variant. The system automatically selects the correct variant (outline or filled) based on the context. Additionally, you can change a tab’s properties, such as `title` or `image`, at runtime, and the system automatically updates its appearance.

// Create the tab bar controller.
let tabBarController = UITabBarController()

// Assign an array of tabs.
tabBarController.tabs = [\
\
UITab(title: "First",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "1.circle"),\
identifier: "First Tab") { _ in\
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.\
MyFirstViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(title: "Second",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "2.circle"),\
identifier: "Second Tab") { _ in\
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.\
MySecondViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(title: "Third",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "3.circle"),\
identifier: "Third Tab") { _ in\
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.\
MyThirdViewController()\
}\
]

To add a search tab, create a `UISearchTab` instance and add it to the tabs array.

// Create a search tab.
UISearchTab { _ in
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.
UINavigationController(
rootViewController: MySearchViewController()
)
}

The new iPad tab bar supports an unlimited number of items. If there isn’t enough room to display all the tabs, the system collapses any tabs that can’t fit onscreen, and lets people scroll through them. However, consider limiting your tabs to just those that fit in the tab bar. This ensures that people can access key parts of your app with one tap.

### Integrate the tab bar and sidebar

Although both tab bars and sidebars play a similar navigation role in iPadOS apps, they have different strengths. A tab bar is always available and represents the key parts of your app. A sidebar provides a richer collection of possible destinations; however, people typically need to navigate

Use the new `UITab` and `UITabGroup` classes to create a hierarchy of tabs. If the tabs array contains at least one tab group, the system automatically displays the tabs as both a tab bar and a sidebar. Otherwise, it only displays the array as a tab bar. You can also explicitly define how the system displays your tabs by setting the `UITabBarController` object’s `mode` property.

// Enable the sidebar.
tabBarController.mode = .tabSidebar

// Get the sidebar.
let sidebar = tabBarController.sidebar

// Show the sidebar.
sidebar.isHidden = false

By default, the system presents the sidebar in landscape orientation and hides it in portrait orientation; however, people can toggle between the tab bar and sidebar in either orientation. You can also programmatically show and hide the sidebar by setting its `isHidden` property.

### Build a hierarchy of items for the sidebar

You can use `UITabGroup` to define a section of items in the sidebar. Provide an array of tabs for the section’s content and a view controller to display when someone selects the section from the tab bar.

let sectionOne = UITabGroup(
title: "Section 1",
image: UIImage(systemName: "1.square.fill"),
identifier: "Section one",
children:
[\
UITab(\
title: "Subitem A",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "a.circle"),\
identifier: "Section 1, item A"\
) { _ in\
MyFirstSubitemTabViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(\
title: "Subitem B",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "b.circle"),\
identifier: "Section 1, item b"\
) { _ in\
MySecondSubitemTabViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(\
title: "Subitem C",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "c.circle"),\
identifier: "Section 1, item C"\
) { _ in\
MyThirdSubitemTabViewController()\
},\
]) { _ in
// Return a view controller that the system displays when someone selects the section in the tab bar.
MySectionViewController()
}

The tab bar displays a tab group as a single tab item, and the sidebar displays it as a section that contains subitems. The sidebar displays top-level tab items first, followed by the sections.

You can nest a `UITabGroup` inside another `UITabGroup` to create a deeper hierarchy in the sidebar; however, consider limiting your app to two, or at most three, layers. Also, you can dynamically change a tab group’s content at runtime by modifying its `children` property.

### Add actions to the sidebar

You can add actions to the sidebar by setting a tab group’s `sidebarActions` property. These actions function like buttons that you place inside the tab group.

// Create the action.
let refreshAction = UIAction(title: "Refresh", image: UIImage(systemName: "arrow.clockwise")) { _ in
myAction()
}

// Assign the action.
sectionOne.sidebarActions = [refreshAction]

To support swipe actions or context menus, assign a delegate to your sidebar that adopts the `UITabBarController.Sidebar.Delegate` protocol, and implement the following optional methods:

- `tabBarController(_:sidebar:leadingSwipeActionsConfigurationFor:)`

- `tabBarController(_:sidebar:trailingSwipeActionsConfigurationFor:)`

- `tabBarController(_:sidebar:contextMenuConfigurationFor:)`

To support drag-and-drop operations, assign a delegate to your tab bar that adopts the `UITabBarControllerDelegate` protocol, and implement the `tabBarController(_:tab:operationForAcceptingItemsFrom:)` and `tabBarController(_:tab:acceptItemsFrom:)` methods.

### Enable customization

With the new tab bar and sidebar, people can customize the content in both. The system provides a button to put the bars into edit mode. While editing, people can:

- Drag items from the sidebar to the tab bar to add them to the tab bar.

- Drag items from the tab bar to remove them from the tab bar.

- Drag items to reorder them in the tab bar.

- Drag items to reorder them inside their tab group.

- Uncheck items in the sidebar to hide them. This also removes them from the tab bar.

The system automatically persists any customizations that someone makes to the bars. You can implement the `tabBarController(_:displayOrderDidChangeFor:)` and `tabBarController(_:visibilityDidChangeFor:)` delegate methods to receive notifications about the changes.

By default, only the top-level tabs appear in the tab bar. People can add or remove any tab in the sidebar, but can’t hide or reorder the items in it.

To control which items appear in the tab bar, and how people can customize them, set the `UITab` object’s `preferredPlacement` property. Conceptually, you can think of the tab bar as having three different regions:

- Fixed tabs appear on the leading edge of the tab bar.

- Default, optional, and movable tabs appear after the fixed tabs.

- Pinned tabs are always visible on the trailing edge, and only show the tab’s image.

When possible, make tabs customizable so that people can choose which ones to place in the tab bar. If you have any tabs that are central to your app, consider making them fixed tabs, so that people can’t remove or move them. Use pinned tabs for prominent items, like search. Also, because pinned tabs only display the tab icon, be sure to select an image that people recognize and can easily understand.

To create an item that appears in the sidebar, but that people can’t add to the tab bar, set the `preferredPlacement` property to `UITab.Placement.sidebarOnly`. To create an item that people can add to or remove from the sidebar, set its `allowsHiding` property to `true`. If someone removes an item from the sidebar, the system also removes it from the tab bar.

// Create the tab.
var customizeableItem = UITab(
title: "Optional",
image: UIImage(systemName: "questionmark.app"),
identifier: "Optional Item"
) { _ in
MyOptionalViewController()
}

// Let people add and remove this item in the sidebar.
customizeableItem.allowsHiding = true

// Set the item as hidden in the sidebar by default.
customizeableItem.isHiddenByDefault = true

To let people reorganize items within a tab group, set the group’s `allowsReordering` property to `true`.

sectionOne.allowsReordering = true

You can also programmatically set the order of items in a tab group using its `displayOrderIdentifiers` property. By default, the system sets the tab group’s order based on its `children` property.

### Use the tab bar and sidebar on other platforms

The new `UITab` API is also available in iOS 18, Mac Catalyst 18, tvOS 18, and visionOS 2, and later. Consider using this API to create tab bars on all UIKit-based projects.

The new tab bar and sidebar only appear on iPad. On iPhone and Apple TV, the system displays the platform’s regular tab bar. For Mac Catalyst, it displays a tab bar if the tab bar controller’s `mode` property is `UITabBarController.Mode.tabBar`, and a sidebar if it’s `UITabBarController.Mode.tabSidebar`.

In visionOS, the system displays the platform’s regular tabs, but a `UITabGroup` can display a sidebar when it displays the group’s view controller.

Sample Code

# Supporting desktop-class features in your iPad app

Enhance your iPad app by adding desktop-class features and document support.

Download

Xcode 15.0+

## Overview

This sample project shows how to build an app that takes full advantage of the iPad’s desktop-class features like hardware keyboard and trackpad support, Stage Manager, and rich document-editing capabilities. The app is a markup document editor that allows creating, editing, previewing, and saving documents, including features like a title menu with custom actions, document renaming, Find and Replace, and more.

### Choose the appropriate navigation style

Because the app allows focused viewing and editing of individual documents, it uses the `UINavigationItem.ItemStyle.editor` navigation style. This navigation style moves the navigation item’s title to the leading edge and opens up space in the center of the bar for common document actions. To choose the navigation style, the editor view controller assigns the navigation item’s `style` property.

### Add center items for quick access to common actions

Center item groups are groups of controls that appear in the navigation bar to provide quick access to the app’s most important capabilities. A person can customize the navigation bar’s center items by moving, removing, or adding certain groups. To enable user customization, the app assigns a string to the navigation item’s `customizationIdentifier` property.

// Set a `customizationIdentifier` and add center item groups.
navigationItem.customizationIdentifier = "editorViewCustomization"

The editor view controller configures center items and assigns them to the navigation item’s `centerItemGroups` property in `configureCenterItemGroups()`. The editor view controller creates one fixed group that people can’t move or remove from the navigation bar for the Sync Scrolling item using `creatingFixedGroup()`.

UIBarButtonItem(primaryAction: UIAction(title: "Sync Scrolling", image: syncScrollingImage) { [unowned self] action in
syncScrolling.toggle()
if let barButtonItem = action.sender as? UIBarButtonItem {
barButtonItem.image = syncScrollingImage
}
}).creatingFixedGroup(),

Other center item groups are optional, which means people can customize their placement in the navigation bar. Optional groups that have `isInDefaultCustomization` set to `false` don’t appear in the navigation bar by default. They appear in the customization popover that a person can access by choosing the customization option in the overflow menu.

UIBarButtonItem(primaryAction: UIAction(title: "Strikethrough", image: UIImage(systemName: "strikethrough")) { [unowned self] _ in
insertTag(.strikethrough)
}).creatingOptionalGroup(customizationIdentifier: "strikethrough", isInDefaultCustomization: false),

### Add a title menu with system and custom actions

A title menu appears when a person taps the navigation item’s title. This menu can surface actions that are relevant to the current document. To configure a title menu, the editor view controller assigns a closure to the navigation item’s `titleMenuProvider` property.

navigationItem.titleMenuProvider = { suggested in
let custom = [\
UIMenu(title: "Export…", image: UIImage(systemName: "arrow.up.forward.square"), children: [\
UIAction(title: "HTML", image: UIImage(systemName: "safari")) { [unowned self] _ in\
previewView.exportAsWebArchive(named: document.localizedName, presenter: self)\
},\
UIAction(title: "PDF", image: UIImage(systemName: "doc.richtext")) { [unowned self] _ in\
previewView.exportAsPDF(named: document.localizedName, presenter: self)\
}\
])\
]
return UIMenu(children: suggested + custom)
}

The closure returns a menu that combines the suggested system actions and custom actions. The first set of actions in the menu are the `suggested` actions that the system passes in to the closure, including Move and Duplicate. The next set of actions are the `custom` actions that the app defines: exporting the document to HTML and PDF.

### Configure a document header

A document header displays helpful information about the current document, such as its title, file type, and size. It also provides a place from which to share or drag and drop the document. To display a document header at the top of the title menu, the editor view controller assigns a `UIDocumentProperties` object to the navigation item’s `documentProperties` property.

### Enable the system Find and Replace experience

The editor view supports editing the content of the document. Because the editor view is a subclass of `UITextView`, enabling the system Find and Replace experience takes one line of code.

// Enable Find and Replace in editor text view and register as its
// delegate.
editorTextView.isFindInteractionEnabled = true

Setting the `isFindInteractionEnabled` property enables using standard keyboard shortcuts to find text in a document and quickly replace it using the system-provided Find panel.

### Enhance multiple-item selection

The outline view is a collection view that serves as a table of contents for the document, allowing for quick navigation or taking actions on the top-level tags in the document. This view supports an enhanced multiple-selection experience when a person interacts with the app using a keyboard and pointer. The outline view enables lightweight multiple selection of the tags without placing the collection view into editing mode by setting `allowsMultipleSelection`, `allowsFocus`, and `selectionFollowsFocus` to `true`.

// Enable multiple selection.
collectionView.allowsMultipleSelection = true

// Enable keyboard focus.
collectionView.allowsFocus = true

// Allow keyboard focus to drive selection.
collectionView.selectionFollowsFocus = true

A person can use the keyboard and pointer to select tags, and perform a secondary click to open a context menu with relevant actions. The outline view presents a specialized context menu according to the number of tags in the selection by implementing `collectionView(_:contextMenuConfigurationForItemsAt:point:)` to return different configurations when the selection contains one or many tags.

// Action titles for a multiple-item menu.
hideTitle = "Hide Selected"
deleteTitle = "Delete Selected"
} else {
// Action titles for a single-item menu.
hideTitle = "Hide"
deleteTitle = "Delete"
}

### Perform a primary action when tapping a single item

In addition to performing a secondary click on a tag in the outline view, a person can tap a single tag to scroll to its corresponding location in the editor view. To distinguish the explicit user action of tapping one tag to navigate to that location in the document from selecting multiple tags, the outline view implements `collectionView(_:performPrimaryActionForItemAt:)`. The system calls this method when a person taps a single tag without extending a multiple selection of tags.

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, performPrimaryActionForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
// Get the element at the `indexPath`.
if let element = dataSource.itemIdentifier(for: indexPath) {
delegate?.outline(self, didChoose: element)
}

// Wait a short amount of time before deselecting the cell for visual clarity.
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.2) {
collectionView.deselectItem(at: indexPath, animated: true)
}
}

# Multitasking on iPad

Implement multitasking APIs to seamlessly integrate your app with iPadOS.

## Overview

While your app’s scene runs in the foreground on iPad, other apps are likely to be running alongside it. Being aware of the environment your app may be running in and adopting the multitasking APIs are an essential part of integrating your apps with iPadOS.

The first step to creating a great multitasking experience for your users is to ensure your app’s scenes can adapt to different window sizes. Start by reading the Adaptivity and Layout section of the Human Interface Guidelines. Also, consider that your app may not be running full screen, but in a smaller window through Slide Over or Split View. Discover your app’s environment with `UITraitCollection` and adapt to it by using Auto Layout, or by overriding `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` in your view controllers or views.

You can choose to allow multiple scenes in your app’s UI to run concurrently by setting the `UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes` property list key. Implement Scenes and read Managing your app’s life cycle for an overview of how `UISceneDelegate` interacts with the system multitasking events. For information on adopting the scene-based life cycle, see TN3187: Migrating to the UIKit scene-based life cycle.

Design your app’s scenes to display correctly in any interface orientation. In situations where you want to lock the app’s interface to its current orientation, call `setNeedsUpdateOfPrefersInterfaceOrientationLocked()`, then return `true` as the value of `prefersInterfaceOrientationLocked`, or override `childViewControllerForInterfaceOrientationLock` to delegate the decision to a child view controller. Implement `windowScene(_:didUpdateEffectiveGeometry:)` to observe orientation changes, as the system might change the interface orientation even if you signal a preference to lock it. The preference to lock the interface orientation lasts until your app stops presenting the scene, or you call `setNeedsUpdateOfPrefersInterfaceOrientationLocked()` again and return `false` as the value of `prefersInterfaceOrientationLocked`.

Protocol

# UIGuidedAccessRestrictionDelegate

A set of methods you use to add custom restrictions for the Guided Access feature in iOS.

tvOS

@MainActor
protocol UIGuidedAccessRestrictionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Custom restrictions are represented by string identifiers provided by the developer in the `guidedAccessRestrictionIdentifiers` method. Each identifier represents an operation in the app that the developer wishes to allow users to restrict using Guided Access. The default for all operations is allow. Users can deny operations using the normal Guided Access user interface. See for a description of how to enable and configure Guided Access on iOS.

Apps describe their custom restrictions by implementing the `textForGuidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:)` and `detailTextForGuidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:)` methods to return appropriate localized, human-readable strings.

For example, a photo editing app might allow users to disable deleting photos. The app would return an identifier representing this restriction in its `guidedAccessRestrictionIdentifiers` method. It would also implement `textForGuidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:)` to provide a human-readable description of the restriction. Finally, the app would implement `guidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:didChange:)` to notice when a user indicates that they want to enable the restriction. When the app sees the state change to “deny”, it would configure itself to prevent the deletion of photos by any means. Similarly, when the app sees the state change to “allow”, it would configure itself to allow photo deletion.

Apps can use the `guidedAccessRestrictionState(forIdentifier:)` function to check the state of a restriction at any time.

# Updating your app from 32-bit to 64-bit architecture

Ensure that your app behaves as expected by adapting it to support later versions of the operating system.

## Overview

In iOS 11 and later, all apps use the 64-bit architecture. If your app targets an earlier version of iOS, you must update it to run on later versions.

### Update your app to the latest SDK

Begin by updating your existing app to iOS 11 or later. By updating your app first, you can remove deprecated code paths, address any compiler warnings, and search your code for specific 64-bit issues.

1. Install the latest version of Xcode and open your project. Xcode prompts you to _modernize_ the project. Modernizing adds new warnings and errors that are important when compiling your app for 64-bit architecture.

2. Update your project settings to support the latest version of iOS. You can’t build a 64-bit project if it targets an iOS version earlier than iOS 5.1.

3. Change the Architectures build setting in your project to Standard Architectures.

4. Update your app to support the 64-bit runtime environment. The new compiler warnings and errors help guide you through this process.

5. Test your app on actual 64-bit hardware. Don’t rely on the Simulator app. Although it can be helpful during development, some changes, such as the function-calling conventions, are visible only when your app is running on a device.

6. Tune your app’s memory performance by using Instruments.

### Audit your code

It’s critical that you review your code for proper pointer usage. Assumptions in pointer sizes can lead to erratic behavior and even crashes. Focus on the following areas:

- Updating data structures. Eliminate assumptions about type size and alignment in structures, and use explicit data types.

- Auditing pointer usage. Adhere to proper casting behaviors and review your methods for allocating memory.

- Managing functions and function pointers **.** Use function prototypes for safety, and review the calling of functions that have variable-length argument lists.

With pointer usage addressed, your app should be stable and you can focus on performance and optimize accordingly:

- Optimizing memory performance. Establish performance tests that measure your use of memory in the context of 64-bit runtime.

- Verifying mathematical calculations. Verify signed values in math operations to ensure accurate results, and review your use of bit mask operations.

## Topics

### Memory and pointer access

Updating data structures

Review your app’s data design and update it to conform with 64-bit architecture.

Auditing pointer usage

Function

# UIApplicationMain(\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Creates the application object and the application delegate and sets up the event cycle.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

func UIApplicationMain(
_ argc: Int32,

_ principalClassName: String?,
_ delegateClassName: String?

## Parameters

`argc`

The count of arguments in `argv`; this usually is the corresponding parameter to `main`.

`argv`

A variable list of arguments; this usually is the corresponding parameter to `main`.

`principalClassName`

The name of the `UIApplication` class or subclass. If you specify `nil`, `UIApplication` is assumed.

`delegateClassName`

The name of the class from which the application delegate is instantiated. If `principalClassName` designates a subclass of `UIApplication`, you may designate the subclass as the delegate; the subclass instance receives the application-delegate messages. Specify `nil` if you load the delegate object from your application’s main nib file.

## Return Value

Even though an integer return type is specified, this function never returns. When users exits an iOS app by pressing the Home button, the application moves to the background.

## Mentioned in

About the app launch sequence

## Discussion

This function instantiates the application object from the principal class and instantiates the delegate (if any) from the given class and sets the delegate for the application. It also sets up the main event loop, including the application’s run loop, and begins processing events. If the application’s `Info.plist` file specifies a main nib file to be loaded, by including the `NSMainNibFile` key and a valid nib file name for the value, this function loads that nib file.

Despite the declared return type, this function never returns.

# Requesting access to protected resources

Provide a purpose string that explains to a person why you need access to protected resources on their device.

## Overview

Modern devices collect and store a wealth of sensitive information about people who use them. Many apps rely on this kind of data, and the device hardware that generates it, to do useful work. For example, a navigation app needs a person’s GPS coordinates to locate the person on a map. But not all apps need access to all data. The same navigation app doesn’t need access to a person’s health history, camera interface, or Bluetooth peripherals.

Ensure your app accesses only what it needs to do its job. To support this principle, Apple’s operating systems restrict access to protected data and resources by default. Apps can request access on a case-by-case basis, providing an explanation for why they need access. The person who uses the app decides whether to grant or deny the request.

### Provide a purpose string

The first time your app attempts to access a protected resource, the system prompts the person using the app for permission. In the following example, an iOS app called FoodDeliveryApp, which provides a food delivery service, generates a prompt requesting access to the person’s location:

If the person grants permission, the system remembers the person’s choice and doesn’t prompt again. If the person denies permission, the access attempt that initiates the prompt, and any further attempts, fail in a resource-specific way. For the particular case of access to location data, the person can choose to allow access for one session only by tapping Allow Once.

The system automatically generates the prompt’s title, which includes the name of your app. You supply a message called a _purpose string_ or a _usage description_ — in this case, “Your location allows you to view restaurants in delivery range of your address.” — to indicate the reason that your app needs the access. Accurately and concisely explaining to the person why your app needs access to sensitive data, typically in one complete sentence, lets the person make an informed decision and improves the chances that they grant access.

You provide a purpose string by setting a string value for a resource-specific key that you add to your app’s `Information Property List` file. The message in the image above, for example, is a string associated with the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key. Modify your `Info.plist` file using the property list editor in Xcode.

Always provide a valid purpose string in the `Info.plist` file if your app uses a protected resource. If you don’t, attempts to access the resource fail, and might even cause your app to crash.

If your app supports multiple locales, in addition to providing a purpose string in the `Info.plist` file, localize it, and place the localized string in the `InfoPlist.strings` files for each locale you want to support.

### Adhere to the requirements for purpose strings

To give people useful, concise information about why you’re requesting access to protected resources, make sure each purpose string you provide is valid by checking the following:

- The purpose string isn’t blank and doesn’t consist solely of whitespace characters.

- The purpose string is shorter than 4,000 bytes. Typical purpose strings are one complete sentence, but you can provide additional information to help a person make the right decision about sharing personal information.

- The purpose string has the proper type that the corresponding key requires, typically a string.

- The purpose string provides a description that’s accurate, meaningful, and specific about why the app needs to access the protected resource.

Adhere to these requirements for every purpose string in the `Info.plist` file and locale-specific `InfoPlist.strings` files.

App Review checks for the use of protected resources, and rejects apps that contain code accessing those resources without a purpose string. For example, an app accessing location might receive the following information from App Review about the requirement that an `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key be present:

ITMS-90683: Missing purpose string in Info.plist.
Your app’s code references one or more APIs that access sensitive user
data, or the app has one or more entitlements that permit such access.
The Info.plist file for the "{app-bundle-path}" bundle should contain a
NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key with a user-facing purpose string
explaining clearly and completely why your app needs the data.
If you’re using external libraries or SDKs, they may reference APIs that
require a purpose string. While your app might not use these APIs, a
purpose string is still required. For details, visit:

To resolve this issue, provide a purpose string that explains why the app needs access to this sensitive information, or remove the code that’s accessing the resource.

### Check for authorization

Many system frameworks that provide access to protected resources have dedicated APIs for checking and requesting authorization to use those resources. This model allows you to adjust your app’s behavior depending on the current access it has. For example, if a person denies your app permission to do something, you can remove related elements from your user interface.

Because a person can change authorization at any time using Settings, always check the authorization status of a feature before accessing it. In cases without a dedicated API, prepare your app to gracefully handle access failures.

### Reset authorization access

When your app attempts to access a protected resource after its first attempt, the system remembers the person’s permission choice and doesn’t prompt again. To prompt the person again, you need to reset access to these resources on your device or system.

$ tccutil reset AppleEvents

This command resets authorization access for all apps using the protected resource. You can similarly specify Camera, Calendar, Reminders, or other services to reset them individually.

# Encrypting Your App’s Files

Protect the user’s data in iOS by encrypting it on disk.

## Overview

Data protection is an iOS feature that you use to secure your app’s files and prevent unauthorized access to them. Data protection is enabled automatically when the user sets an active passcode for the device. You read and write your files normally, but the system encrypts and decrypts your content behind the scenes. The encryption and decryption processes are automatic and hardware accelerated.

You specify the level of data protection that you want to apply to each of your files. There are four levels available, each of which determines when you may access the file. If you do not specify a protection level when creating a file, iOS applies the default protection level automatically.

- **No protection.** The file is always accessible.

- **Complete until first user authentication.** (Default) The file is inaccessible until the first time the user unlocks the device. After the first unlocking of the device, the file remains accessible until the device shuts down or reboots.

- **Complete unless open.** You can open existing files only when the device is unlocked. If you have a file already open, you may continue to access that file even after the user locks the device. You can also create new files and access them while the device is locked or unlocked.

- **Complete.** The file is accessible only when the device is unlocked.

To create and encrypt a new file in one step, construct a data object with the file’s contents and call the `write(to:options:)` method. When calling the method, specify the data protection option that you want applied to the file. The following code shows an example of how to write out the contents of a `Data` instance to a file and encrypt it using the complete protection level.

do {
try data.write(to: fileURL, options: .completeFileProtection)
}
catch {
// Handle errors.
}

To change the data protection level of an existing file, use the `setResourceValue(_:forKey:)` method of `NSURL`. When calling this method, assign the new data protection option to the `fileProtectionKey` resource key. The following code shows an example that adds this key to an existing file.

do {
try (fileURL as NSURL).setResourceValue(
URLFileProtection.complete,
forKey: .fileProtectionKey)
}
catch {
// Handle errors.
}

### Manage Your Access to Encrypted Files

Depending on a file’s protection level, attempts to read or write its contents could fail when the user subsequently locks the device. To ensure that your app is able to access files, do the following:

- Choose the right data protection level for your needs.

- Use the app delegate’s `applicationProtectedDataWillBecomeUnavailable(_:)` and `applicationProtectedDataDidBecomeAvailable(_:)` methods to close and reopen files with the `completeFileProtection` level.

Assign the complete protection level to files that your app accesses only when it is in the foreground. If your app supports background capabilities, such as handling location updates, assign a different protection level for files that you might access while in the background. For example, a fitness app might use the complete unless open protection level on a file that it uses to log location events in the background.

Files containing personal information about the user, or files created directly by the user, always warrant the strongest level of protection. Assign the complete protection level to user data files and manage access to those files using the app delegate methods. The app delegate methods give you time to close the files before they become inaccessible to your app.

Instance Property

# identifierForVendor

An alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies a device to the app’s vendor.

tvOS

@MainActor
var identifierForVendor: UUID? { get }

## Discussion

The value of this property is the same for apps that come from the same vendor running on the same device. A different value is returned for apps on the same device that come from different vendors, and for apps on different devices regardless of vendor.

Normally, the vendor is determined by data provided by the App Store. If the app wasn’t installed from the app store (such as enterprise apps and apps still in development), then a vendor identifier is calculated based on the app’s bundle ID. The bundle ID is assumed to be in reverse-DNS format.

- In iOS 6, the first two components of the bundle ID are used to generate the vendor ID. If the bundle ID only has a single component, then the entire bundle ID is used.

- In IOS 7, all components of the bundle except for the last component are used to generate the vendor ID. If the bundle ID only has a single component, then the entire bundle ID is used.

The following table shows a collection of bundle IDs and which portions of the bundle ID the system uses to calculate the vendor ID.

| Bundle ID | iOS 6.x | iOS 7.x |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Com.example.app1 | **Com.example**.app1 | **Com.example**.app1 |
| Com.example.app2 | **Com.example**.app2 | **Com.example**.app2 |
| Com.example.app.app1 | **Com.example**.app.app1 | **Com.example.app**.app1 |
| Com.example.app.app2 | **Com.example**.app.app2 | **Com.example.app**.app2 |
| Example | **Example** | **Example** |

For example, `com.example.app1` and `com.example.app2` would appear to have the same vendor ID.

If the value is `nil`, wait and get the value again later. This happens, for example, after the device has been restarted but before the user has unlocked the device.

The value in this property remains the same while the app (or another app from the same vendor) is installed on the iOS device. The value changes when the user deletes all of that vendor’s apps from the device and subsequently reinstalls one or more of them. The value can also change when installing test builds using Xcode or when installing an app on a device using ad-hoc distribution. Therefore, if your app stores the value of this property anywhere, you should gracefully handle situations where the identifier changes.

Class

# UIControl

The base class for controls, which are visual elements that convey a specific action or intention in response to user interactions.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIControl

## Mentioned in

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

## Overview

Controls implement elements such as buttons and sliders, which your app can use to facilitate navigation, gather user input, or manipulate content. Controls use the target-action mechanism to report user interactions to your app.

You don’t create instances of this class directly. The `UIControl` class is a subclassing point that you extend to implement custom controls. You can also subclass existing control classes to extend or modify their behaviors. For example, you might override the methods of this class to track touch events yourself or to determine when the state of the control changes.

A control’s state determines its appearance and its ability to support user interactions. Controls can be in one of several states, which the `UIControl.State` type defines. You can change the state of a control programmatically according to your app’s needs. For example, you might disable a control to prevent the user from interacting with it. User interactions can also change the state of a control.

### Respond to user interaction

The target-action mechanism simplifies the code that you write to use controls in your app. Instead of writing code to track touch events, you write action methods to respond to control-specific events. For example, you might write an action method that responds to changes in the value of a slider. The control handles all the work of tracking incoming touch events and determining when to call your methods.

When adding an action method to a control, you specify both the action method and an object that defines that method to the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method. (You can also configure the target and action of a control in Interface Builder.) The target object can be any object, but it’s typically the view controller’s root view that contains the control. If you specify `nil` for the target object, the control searches the responder chain for an object that defines the specified action method.

The signature of an action method takes one of three forms. The `sender` parameter corresponds to the control that calls the action method, and the `event` parameter corresponds to the `UIEvent` object that triggered the control-related event.

@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIButton)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIButton, forEvent event: UIEvent)

- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent*)event;

The system calls action methods when the user interacts with the control in specific ways. The `UIControl.Event` type defines the types of user interactions that a control can report and those interactions mostly correlate to specific touch events within the control. When configuring a control, you must specify which events trigger the calling of your method. For a button control, you might use the `touchDown` or `touchUpInside` event to trigger calls to your action method. For a slider, you might care only about changes to the slider’s value, so you might choose to attach your action method to `valueChanged` events.

When a control-specific event occurs, the control calls any associated action methods immediately. The current `UIApplication` object dispatches action methods and finds an appropriate object to handle the message, following the responder chain, if necessary. For more information about responders and the responder chain, see Event Handling Guide for UIKit Apps.

### Configure control attributes in Interface Builder

The following table lists the attributes for instances of the `UIControl` class.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Alignment | The horizontal and vertical alignment of a control’s content. For controls that contain text or images, such as buttons and text fields, use these attributes to configure the position of that content within the control’s bounds. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) These alignment options apply to the content of a control and not to the control itself. For information about how to align controls with respect to other controls and views, see Auto Layout Guide. |
| Content | The initial state of the control. Use the checkboxes to configure whether the control is in an enabled, selected, or highlighted state initially. |

### Support localization

Because `UIControl` is an abstract class, you don’t internationalize it specifically. However, you do internationalize the content of subclasses like `UIButton`. For information about internationalizing a specific control, see the reference for that control.

### Make controls accessible

Controls are accessible by default. To be useful, an accessible user interface element must provide accurate and helpful information about its screen position, name, behavior, value, and type. This is the information VoiceOver speaks to users. Users who are blind or have low vision can rely on VoiceOver to help them use their devices.

Controls support the following accessibility attributes:

- **Label.** A short, localized word or phrase that succinctly describes the control or view, but doesn’t identify the element’s type. Examples are _Add_ and _Play_.

- **Traits.** A combination of one or more individual traits, each of which describes a single aspect of an element’s state, behavior, or usage. For example, you might use a combination of the Keyboard Key and the Selected traits to describe an element that behaves like a keyboard key and that’s in a selected state.

- **Hint.** A brief, localized phrase that describes the results of an action on an element. Examples are _Adds a title_ and _Opens the shopping list_.

- **Frame.** The frame of the element in screen coordinates, which the `CGRect` structure specifies for an element’s screen location and size.

- **Value.** The current value of an element when the label doesn’t represent the value. For example, the label for a slider might be _Speed_, but its current value might be _50%_.

The `UIControl` class provides default content for the value and frame attributes. Many controls automatically enable additional specific traits as well. You can configure other accessibility attributes programmatically or with the Identity inspector in Interface Builder.

For more information about accessibility attributes, see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

### Subclassing notes

Subclassing `UIControl` gives you access to the built-in target-action mechanism and simplified event-handling support. You can subclass existing controls and modify their behavior in one of two ways:

- Override the `sendAction(_:to:for:)` method of an existing subclass to observe or modify the dispatching of action methods to the control’s associated targets. You might use this method to modify the dispatch behavior for the specified object, selector, or event.

- Override the `beginTracking(_:with:)`, `continueTracking(_:with:)`, `endTracking(_:with:)`, and `cancelTracking(with:)` methods to track touch events occurring in the control. You can use the tracking information to perform additional actions. Always use these methods to track touch events instead of the methods that the `UIResponder` class defines.

If you subclass `UIControl` directly, your subclass is responsible for setting up and managing your control’s visual appearance. Use the methods for tracking events to update your control’s state and to send an action when the control’s value changes.

class UIStackView

## Overview

Stack views let you leverage the power of Auto Layout, creating user interfaces that can dynamically adapt to the device’s orientation, screen size, and any changes in the available space. The stack view manages the layout of all the views in its `arrangedSubviews` property. These views are arranged along the stack view’s axis, based on their order in the `arrangedSubviews` array. The exact layout varies depending on the stack view’s `axis`, `distribution`, `alignment`, `spacing`, and other properties.

To use a stack view, open the Storyboard you wish to edit. Drag either a Horizontal Stack View or a Vertical Stack View out from the Object library, and position the stack view where desired. Next, drag out the stack’s content, dropping the view or control into the stack. You can continue to add views and controls to your stack, as needed. Interface Builder resizes the stack based on its content. You can also adjust the appearance of the stack’s content by modifying the Stack View’s properties in the Attributes inspector.

### Stack view and Auto Layout

The stack view uses Auto Layout to position and size its arranged views. The stack view aligns the first and last arranged view with its edges along the stack’s axis. In a horizontal stack, this means the first arranged view’s leading edge is pinned to the stack’s leading edge, and the last arranged view’s trailing edge is pinned to the stack’s trailing edge. In vertical stacks, the top and bottom edges are pinned to the stack’s top and bottom edges, respectively. If you set the stack view’s `isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement` property to `true`, the stack view pins its content to the relevant margin instead of its edge.

For all distributions except the `UIStackView.Distribution.fillEqually` distribution, the stack view uses each arranged view’s `intrinsicContentSize` property when calculating its size along the stack’s axis. `UIStackView.Distribution.fillEqually` resizes all the arranged views so they’re the same size, filling the stack view along its axis. If possible, the stack view stretches all the arranged views to match the view with the longest intrinsic size along the stack’s axis.

For all alignments except the `UIStackView.Alignment.fill` alignment, the stack view uses each arranged view’s `intrinsicContentSize` property when calculating its size perpendicular to the stack’s axis. `UIStackView.Alignment.fill` resizes all the arranged views so that they fill the stack view perpendicularly to its axis. If possible, the stack view stretches all the arranged views to match the view with the largest intrinsic size perpendicular to the stack’s axis.

#### Position and size the stack view

Although a stack view allows you to lay out its contents without using Auto Layout directly, you still need to use Auto Layout to position the stack view itself. In general, this means pinning at least two adjacent edges of the stack view to define its position. Without additional constraints, the system calculates the size of the stack view based on its contents.

- Along the stack view’s axis, its fitting size is equal to the sum of the sizes of all the arranged views plus the space between views.

- Perpendicular to the stack view’s axis, its fitting size is equal to the size of the largest arranged view.

- If the stack view’s `isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement` property is set to `true`, the stack view’s fitting size is increased to include space for the margins.

You can provide additional constraints to specify the stack view’s height, width, or both. In these cases, the stack view adjusts the layout and size of its arranged views to fill the specified area. The exact layout varies based on the stack view’s properties. See the `UIStackView.Distribution` and `UIStackView.Alignment` enumerations for a complete description on how the stack view handles having either extra space or insufficient space for its content.

You can also position a stack view based on its first or last baseline, instead of using the top, bottom, or center Y position. Like the stack view’s fitting size, these baselines are calculated based on the stack view’s content.

- A horizontal stack view returns its tallest view for both the `forFirstBaselineLayout` and `forLastBaselineLayout` methods. If the tallest view is also a stack view, it returns the result of calling `forFirstBaselineLayout` or `forLastBaselineLayout` on the nested stack view.

- A vertical stack view returns its first arranged view for `forFirstBaselineLayout` and its last arranged view for `forLastBaselineLayout`. If either of these views are also stack views, then it returns the result of calling `forFirstBaselineLayout` or `forLastBaselineLayout` on the nested stack view.

#### Define common stack view layouts

Common approaches for laying out content using stack views:

**Define the position only.** You can define the stack view’s position by pinning two of its adjacent edges to its superview. In this case, the stack view’s size grows freely in both dimensions, based on its arranged views. This approach is particularly useful when you want the stack view’s content to appear at its intrinsic content size, and you want to arrange other user-interface elements relative to the stack view.

The following image shows a stack view with its leading and top edges pinned to its superview. The labels are first baseline aligned, with an 8-point space between them, left-aligning the stack view’s content in its superview.

**Define the stack’s size along its axis.** In this case, pin both edges of the stack along its axis to its superview, defining the stack view’s size in that dimension. You also need to pin one of the other edges to define the stack view’s position. The stack view sizes and positions its content along its axis to fill the defined space; however, the unpinned edge moves freely, based on the size of the largest arranged view.

The following image shows a stack view with the leading, top, and trailing edges pinned to its superview. Using the fill distribution causes the content to resize to fill the view’s width, and because the text field has a lower content-hugging priority than the label, it’s stretched as necessary.

**Define the stack’s size perpendicular to its axis.** This approach is similar to the previous example, but you pin the two edges perpendicular to the stack view’s axis and only one edge along the axis. This lets the stack view grow and shrink along its axis as you add and remove arranged views. Unless you use a `UIStackView.Distribution.fillEqually` distribution, the arranged views are sized according to their intrinsic content size. Perpendicular to the axis, the views are laid out in the defined space based on the stack view’s alignment.

The following image shows a vertical stack containing four labels and a button. The stack uses 8-point spacing and the center alignment. The stack view’s height grows and shrinks as items are added to or removed from the stack.

**Define the size and position of the stack view.** In this case, you pin all four edges of the stack view, causing the stack view to lay out its content within the provided space.

The following image shows a vertical stack view with all four edges pinned to its superview. By using the center alignment and fill distribution, the stack view ensures that its content is centered horizontally and vertically fills the screen. However, getting the desired layout with this approach requires a couple of additional steps. By default, the stack view vertically stretches the label and not the image view. To resize the image view, lower its content-hugging priority below the label’s content-hugging priority. Additionally, to maintain the image view’s aspect ratio as it resizes, set its Mode to Aspect Fit. Adding an equal width constraint between the image view and the stack view helps ensure the image is sized to fill the available space.

### Manage the stack view’s appearance

A stack view manages the position and size of its arranged views. There are a number of properties that define how the stack view lays out its content.

- The `axis` property determines the stack’s orientation, either vertically or horizontally.

- The `distribution` property determines the layout of the arranged views along the stack’s axis.

- The `alignment` property determines the layout of the arranged views perpendicular to the stack’s axis.

- The `spacing` property determines the minimum spacing between arranged views.

- The `isBaselineRelativeArrangement` property determines whether the vertical spacing between views is measured from the baselines.

- The `isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement` property determines whether the stack view lays out its arranged views relative to its layout margins.

Typically, you use a single stack view to lay out a small number of items. You can build more complex view hierarchies by nesting stack views inside other stack views. For example, the following image shows a vertical stack view containing two horizontal stack views. Each of the horizontal stack views contains a label and a text field.

You can also fine-tune an arranged view’s appearance by adding additional constraints to the arranged view. For example, you can use constraints to set a minimum or maximum height or width for the view. Or you can define an aspect ratio for the view. The stack view uses these constraints when laying out its content.

### Maintain consistency between the arranged views and subviews

The stack view ensures that its `arrangedSubviews` property is always a subset of its `subviews` property. Specifically, the stack view enforces the following rules:

- When the stack view adds a view to its `arrangedSubviews` array, it also adds that view as a subview, if it isn’t already.

- When a subview is removed from the stack view, the stack view also removes it from the `arrangedSubviews` array.

- Removing a view from the `arrangedSubviews` array doesn’t remove it as a subview. The stack view no longer manages the view’s size and position, but the view is still part of the view hierarchy, and is rendered on screen if it’s visible.

Although the `arrangedSubviews` array always contains a subset of the `subviews` array, the order of these arrays remain independent.

- The order of the `arrangedSubviews` array defines the order in which views appear in the stack. For horizontal stacks, the views are laid out in reading order, with the lower index views appearing before the higher index views. In English, for example, the views are laid out in order from left to right. For vertical stacks, the views are laid out from top to bottom, with the lower index views above the higher index views.

- The order of the subviews array defines the Z-order of the subviews. If the views overlap, subviews with a lower index appear behind subviews with a higher index.

### Change the stack view’s content dynamically

The stack view automatically updates its layout whenever views are added, removed, or inserted into the `arrangedSubviews` array, or whenever one of the arranged subviews’s `isHidden` property changes.

// Appears to remove the first arranged view from the stack.
// The view is still inside the stack, it's just no longer visible, and no longer contributes to the layout.
let firstView = stackView.arrangedSubviews[0]
firstView.isHidden = true

// Appears to remove the first arranged view from the stack.
// The view is still inside the stack, it's just no longer visible, and no longer contributes to the layout.
UIView * firstView = self.stackView.arrangedSubviews[0];
firstView.hidden = YES;

The stack view also automatically responds to changes to any of its properties. For example, you can dynamically change the stack’s orientation, by updating the stack view’s `axis` property.

// Toggle between a vertical and horizontal stack.
if stackView.axis == .horizontal {
stackView.axis = .vertical
}
else {
stackView.axis = .horizontal
}

// Toggle between a vertical and horizontal stack.
if (self.stackView.axis == UILayoutConstraintAxisHorizontal) {
self.stackView.axis = UILayoutConstraintAxisVertical;
}
else {
self.stackView.axis = UILayoutConstraintAxisHorizontal;
}

You can animate both changes to the arranged subview’s `isHidden` property and changes to the stack view’s properties by placing these changes inside an animation block.

// Animates removing the first item in the stack.

let firstView = stackView.arrangedSubviews[0]
firstView.isHidden = true
}

// Animates removing the first item in the stack.
[UIView animateWithDuration:0.25 animations:^{\
UIView * firstView = self.stackView.arrangedSubviews[0];\
firstView.hidden = YES;\
}];

Finally, you can define size-class specific values for many of the stack view’s properties directly in Interface Builder. The system automatically animates these changes whenever the stack view’s size class changes.

@MainActor
class UIScrollView

## Overview

`UIScrollView` is the superclass of several UIKit classes, including `UITableView` and `UITextView`.

A scroll view is a view with an origin that’s adjustable over the content view. It clips the content to its frame, which generally (but not necessarily) coincides with that of the app’s main window. A scroll view tracks the movements of fingers, and adjusts the origin accordingly. The view that shows its content through the scroll view draws that portion of itself according to the new origin, which is pinned to an offset in the content view. The scroll view itself does no drawing except for displaying vertical and horizontal scroll indicators. The scroll view must know the size of the content view so it knows when to stop scrolling. By default, it _bounces_ back when scrolling exceeds the bounds of the content.

The object that manages the drawing of content that displays in a scroll view needs to tile the content’s subviews so that no view exceeds the size of the screen. As users scroll in the scroll view, this object adds and removes subviews as necessary.

Because a scroll view has no scroll bars, it must know whether a touch signals an intent to scroll versus an intent to track a subview in the content. To make this determination, it temporarily intercepts a touch-down event by starting a timer and, before the timer fires, seeing if the touching finger makes any movement. If the timer fires without a significant change in position, the scroll view sends tracking events to the touched subview of the content view. If the user then drags their finger far enough before the timer elapses, the scroll view cancels any tracking in the subview and performs the scrolling itself. Subclasses can override the `touchesShouldBegin(_:with:in:)`, `isPagingEnabled`, and `touchesShouldCancel(in:)` methods (which the scroll view calls) to affect how the scroll view handles scrolling gestures.

A scroll view also handles zooming and panning of content. As the user makes a pinch-in or pinch-out gesture, the scroll view adjusts the offset and the scale of the content. When the gesture ends, the object managing the content view updates subviews of the content as necessary. (Note that the gesture can end and a finger might still be down.) While the gesture is in progress, the scroll view doesn’t send any tracking calls to the subview.

The `UIScrollView` class can have a delegate that must adopt the `UIScrollViewDelegate` protocol. For zooming and panning to work, the delegate must implement both `viewForZooming(in:)` and `scrollViewDidEndZooming(_:with:atScale:)`. In addition, the `maximumZoomScale` and `minimumZoomScale` zoom scales must be different.

### State preservation

If you assign a value to this view’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it attempts to preserve its scrolling-related information between app launches. Specifically, the values of the `zoomScale`, `contentInset`, and `contentOffset` properties are preserved. During restoration, the scroll view restores these values so that the content appears scrolled to the same position as before. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

Class

# UICalendarView

A view that displays a calendar with date-specific decorations, and provides for user selection of a single date or multiple dates.

@MainActor
class UICalendarView

## Overview

Use a calendar view to show users specific dates that have additional information (for example, scheduled events) using decorations that you customize. You can also use a calendar view for users to select one specific date, multiple dates, or no date.

To add a calendar view to your interface:

- Configure the Calendar and Locale for your calendar view to display.

- Set a date for the calendar view to initially make visible.

- Create a delegate to provide decorations on specific dates, if desired.

- Set a selection method and delegate to handle date selection.

- Set up Auto Layout to position the calendar view in your interface.

You use a calendar view only for the display and selection of dates. If you want to handle date and time selection, use `UIDatePicker`.

### Configure a calendar view

Configure your calendar view to display the type of calendar appropriate to the user’s location and cultural preference, in the user’s preferred language. By default, a calendar view selects the user’s current `Calendar` and `Locale`. If users can select a different calendar or locale in your app, configure the calendar view to use those selections.

// Create the calendar view.
let calendarView = UICalendarView()

// Create an instance of the Gregorian calendar.
let gregorianCalendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)

// Set the calendar displayed by the view.
calendarView.calendar = gregorianCalendar

// Set the calendar view's locale.
calendarView.locale = Locale(identifier: "zh_TW")

// Set the font design to the rounded system font.
calendarView.fontDesign = .rounded

Then, set the calendar view’s initial display to a starting date that’s appropriate for your use case.

// Set the date to display.
calendarView.visibleDateComponents = DateComponents(
calendar: gregorianCalendar,
year: 2024,
month: 2,
day: 1
)

If you want to restrict the earliest or latest dates a user can view or select in your calendar view, set the `availableDateRange`.

// Specify the starting date.
let fromDateComponents = DateComponents(
calendar: gregorianCalendar,
year: 2024,
month: 1,
day: 1
)

// Specify the ending date.
let toDateComponents = DateComponents(
calendar: gregorianCalendar,
year: 2024,
month: 12,
day: 31
)

// Verify that you have valid start and end dates.
guard let fromDate = fromDateComponents.date, let toDate = toDateComponents.date else {
// Handle the error here.
fatalError("Invalid date components: \(fromDateComponents) and \(toDateComponents)")
}

// Set the range of dates that people can view.
let calendarViewDateRange = DateInterval(start: fromDate, end: toDate)
calendarView.availableDateRange = calendarViewDateRange

### Display decorations for specific dates

Use decorations to show users which specific dates have additional information. Add meaning or emphasis to the decorations by setting the color, size, image, or custom view that you display for a specific date. To display decorations in your calendar view, create a custom `UICalendarViewDelegate` object, implement `calendarView(_:decorationFor:)`, and set your custom object as the calendar view’s delegate.

// Define a calendar view delegate.
class CalendarViewDelegate: NSObject, UICalendarViewDelegate {

var calendarView: UICalendarView? = nil
var decorations: [Date?: UICalendarView.Decoration]

override init() {
// Create the date components for Valentine's day that
// contain the calendar, year, month, and day.
let valentinesDay = DateComponents(
calendar: Calendar(identifier: .gregorian),
year: 2024,
month: 2,
day: 14
)

// Create a calendar decoration for Valentine's day.
let heart = UICalendarView.Decoration.image(
UIImage(systemName: "heart.fill"),
color: UIColor.red,
size: .large
)

decorations = [valentinesDay.date: heart]
}

// Return a decoration (if any) for the specified day.

// Get a copy of the date components that only contain
// the calendar, year, month, and day.
let day = DateComponents(
calendar: dateComponents.calendar,
year: dateComponents.year,
month: dateComponents.month,
day: dateComponents.day
)

// Return any decoration saved for that date.
return decorations[day.date]
}
}

In your implementation, you can decide which type of `UICalendarView.Decoration` best illustrates your user’s events:

- The default decoration, which displays a filled circle you can customize with a color and relative size

- An image decoration, which you can customize with a system symbol or image, color, and relative size

- A custom decoration, which you can customize with a closure that returns your custom view

When your data changes, tell the calendar view to reload decoration views.

// Add a decoration to the specified date.
func add(decoration: UICalendarView.Decoration, on date: Date) {
// Get the calendar, year, month, and day date components for
// the specified date.
let dateComponents = Calendar.current.dateComponents(
[.calendar, .year, .month, .day ],
from: date
)

// Add the decoration to the decorations dictionary.
decorations[dateComponents.date] = decoration

// Reload the calendar view's decorations.
if let calendarView {
calendarView.reloadDecorations(
forDateComponents: [dateComponents],
animated: true
)
}
}

### Handle date selection

Let users select a single date, multiple dates, or no date with your calendar view. First, decide which type of date selection you want. Then create a selection object and delegate for that type, and assign it to the calendar view’s `selectionBehavior`.

let dateSelection = UICalendarSelectionSingleDate(delegate: self)
calendarView.selectionBehavior = dateSelection

The user can then select a date from the calendar view. You can set a selected date programmatically as the following example shows:

let date = DateComponents(
calendar: Calendar(identifier: .gregorian),
year: 2024,
month: 2,
day: 14
)

// Programmatically set the selected date.
dateSelection.selectedDate = date

Next, implement the delegate methods for the selection method to customize your date selection handling.

// Control whether a person can select a given date.
func dateSelection(
_ selection: UICalendarSelectionSingleDate,
canSelectDate dateComponents: DateComponents?

// Allow all dates by returning true if the selection parameter contains
// a date component instance. Prevent someone from clearing the selection
// by returning false if the selection parameter is nil.
return dateComponents != nil
}

// Respond when someone selects or deselects a date. If they selected
// a date, the dateComponent parameter contains the selected date. If they
// cleared the selection, the parameter is nil.
func dateSelection(_ selection: UICalendarSelectionSingleDate, didSelectDate dateComponents: DateComponents?) {
// Update your app.
}

# UIImageView

A view that displays a single image or a sequence of animated images in your interface.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIImageView

## Overview

Image views let you efficiently draw any image that can be specified using a `UIImage` object. For example, you can use the `UIImageView` class to display the contents of many standard image files, such as JPEG and PNG files. You can configure image views programmatically or in your storyboard file and change the images they display at runtime. For animated images, you can also use the methods of this class to start and stop the animation and specify other animation parameters.

### Understand how images are scaled

An image view uses its `contentMode` property and the configuration of the image itself to determine how to display the image. It’s best to specify images whose dimensions match the dimensions of the image view exactly, but image views can scale your images to fit all or some of the available space. If the size of the image view itself changes, it automatically scales the image as needed.

For an image without cap insets, the presentation of the image is determined solely by the image view’s `contentMode` property. The `UIView.ContentMode.scaleAspectFit` and `UIView.ContentMode.scaleAspectFill` modes scale the image to fit or fill the space while maintaining the image’s original aspect ratio. The `UIView.ContentMode.scaleToFill` value scales the image without regard to the original aspect ratio, which can cause the image to appear distorted. Other content modes place the image at the appropriate location in the image view’s bounds without scaling it.

For a resizable image with cap insets, those insets affect the final appearance of the image. Specifically, cap insets define which parts of the image may be scaled and in which directions. You can create a resizable image that stretches using the `resizableImage(withCapInsets:resizingMode:)` method of `UIImage`. When using an image of this type, you typically set the image view’s content mode to `UIView.ContentMode.scaleToFill` so that the image stretches in the appropriate places and fills the image view’s bounds.

For tips on how to prepare images, see Debug issues with your image view. For more information on creating resizable images with cap insets, see `UIImage`.

### Determine the final transparency of the image

Images are composited onto the image view’s background and are then composited into the rest of the window. Any transparency in the image allows the image view’s background to show through. Similarly, any further transparency in the background of the image is dependent on the transparency of the image view and the transparency of the `UIImage` object it displays. When the image view and its image both have transparency, the image view uses alpha blending to combine the two.

- The image is composited onto the image view’s background.

- If the image view’s `isOpaque` property is `true`, the image’s pixels are composited on top of the image view’s background color and the `alpha` property of the image view is ignored.

- If the image view’s `isOpaque` property is `false`, the alpha value of each pixel is multiplied by the image view’s `alpha` value, with the resulting value becoming the actual transparency value for that pixel. If the image doesn’t have an alpha channel, the alpha value of each pixel is assumed to be `1.0`.

### Animate a sequence of images

An image view can store an animated image sequence and play all or part of that sequence. You specify an image sequence as an array of `UIImage` objects and assign them to the `animationImages` property. Once assigned, you can use the methods and properties of this class to configure the animation timing and to start and stop the animation.

Consider the following tips when displaying a sequence of animated images:

- **All images in the sequence should have the same size.** When scaling is required, the image view scales each image in the sequence separately. If the images are different sizes, scaling may not yield the results you want.

- **All images in the sequence should use the same content scale factor.** Make sure the `scale` property of each image contains the same value.

### Respond to touch events

Image views ignore user events by default. Normally, you use image views only to present visual content in your interface. If you want an image view to handle user interactions as well, change the value of its `isUserInteractionEnabled` property to `true`. After doing that, you can attach gesture recognizers or use any other event handling techniques to respond to touch events or other user-initiated events.

For more information about handling events, see Event Handling Guide for UIKit Apps.

### Improve performance

Image scaling and alpha blending are two relatively expensive operations that can impact your app’s performance. To maximize performance of your image view code, consider the following tips:

- **Cache scaled versions of frequently used images.** If you expect certain large images to be displayed frequently in a scaled-down thumbnail view, consider creating the scaled-down images in advance and storing them in a thumbnail cache. Doing so alleviates the need for each image view to scale them separately.

- **Use images whose size is close to the size of the image view.** Rather than assigning a large image to an image view, created a scaled version that matches the current size of the image view. You can also create a resizable image object using the `UIImage.ResizingMode.tile` option, which tiles the image instead of scaling it.

- **Make your image view opaque whenever possible.** Unless you’re intentionally working with images that contain transparency (drawing UI elements, for example), make sure the `isOpaque` property of your image view is set to `true`. For more information about how transparency is determined, see Determine the final transparency of the image.

### Debug issues with your image view

If your image view isn’t displaying what you expected, use the following tips to help diagnose the problem:

- **Load images using the correct method.** Use the `init(named:in:compatibleWith:)` method of `UIImage` to load images from asset catalogs or your app’s bundle. For images outside of your app’s bundle, use the `imageWithContentsOfFile:` method.

- **Don’t use image views for custom drawing.** The `UIImageView` class doesn’t draw its content using the `draw(_:)` method. Use image views only to present images. To do custom drawing involving images, subclass `UIView` directly and draw your image there.

### Interface Builder attributes

The following table lists the attributes that you configure for image views in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Discussion |
| --- | --- |
| Image | The image to display. You can specify any image in your Xcode project, including standalone images and those in image assets. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `image` or `animationImages` property. |
| Highlighted | The image to display when the image view is highlighted. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `highlightedImage` or `highlightedAnimationImages` property. |
| State | The initial state of the image. Use this attribute to mark the image as highlighted. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `isHighlighted` property. |

### Internationalization

Internationalization of image views is automatic if your view displays only static images loaded from your app bundle. If you’re loading images programmatically, you’re at least partially responsible for loading the correct image.

- For resources in your app bundle, you do this by specifying the name in the attributes inspector or by calling the `init(named:)` class method on `UIImage` to obtain the localized version of each image.

- For images that aren’t in your app bundle, your code must do the following:

1. Determine which image to load in a manner specific to your app, such as providing a localized string that contains the URL.

2. Load that image by passing the URL or data for the correct image to an appropriate `UIImage` class method, such as `imageWithData:` or `imageWithContentsOfFile:`.

For more information, see Localization.

### Accessibility

Image views are accessible by default. The default accessibility traits for an image view are Image and User Interaction Enabled.

For more information about making iOS controls accessible, see the accessibility information in `UIControl`. For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility for UIKit.

### State preservation

When you assign a value to an image view’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it attempts to preserve the frame of the displayed image. Specifically, the class preserves the values of the `bounds`, `center`, and `transform` properties of the view and the `anchorPoint` property of the underlying layer. During restoration, the image view restores these values so that the image appears exactly as before. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see Restoring your app’s state.

# Responding to control-based events using target-action

Handle user input by connecting buttons, sliders, and other controls to your app’s code using the target-action design pattern.

## Overview

User interactions generate thousands of events for your app. Every swipe of the finger or button click, for instance, results in numerous events your app has to process.

`Target-action` is a design pattern to help you handle these user interactions efficiently. By only registering actions against specific events on your controls, you simplify your event processing, while making your code more maintainable and easier to read.

Use `target-action` to connect events directly from controls in your UI to methods in your code.

### Designate an object to handle control-related events

When a person interacts with your control, the control needs to know where to send the event. The destination for the event is the _target_. View controllers make good targets because they’re adept at handling user interactions, as well as hosting UI controls.

### Define the action methods you use to respond to events

With a control assigned to the target, provide a function to call on that target when the event occurs. This is the _action_ method.

Action methods have a distinct signature:

// UIKit.
@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: Any)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: Any, forEvent event: UIEvent)

// AppKit.
@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: Any)

// UIKit.
- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)controlEvents;

// AppKit.
- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;

Xcode uses the `@IBAction` keyword to connect controls in Interface Builder to functions in your code. The keyword also bridges the Swift and Objective-C runtimes, enabling Swift code to call into Objective-C, which is where the target-action functionality lives.

The `sender` parameter defines where the event comes from; for example, a button. Use the generic type `Any` to allow any control to call the action method, or specify the `sender` type when you need more information about the control for event processing. For example, set the `sender` type to `UISlider` to read the slider thumb value when someone moves the slider left or right.

// UIKit.
@IBAction func adjustVolume(sender: UISlider) {
print(sender.value)
}

// AppKit.
@IBAction func adjustVolume(sender: NSSlider) {
NSLog("%@", sender.stringValue)
}

// UIKit.
- (IBAction)adjustVolume:(UISlider *)sender {
NSLog(@"%f", sender.value);
}

// AppKit.
- (IBAction)adjustVolume:(NSSlider *)sender {
NSLog(@"%@", [sender stringValue]);
}

UIKit also supports coupling action methods to specific event types (see `UIControl.Event`). For example, to set up target-action for a user dragging their finger inside the bounds of a control, register for the event type `touchDragInside`.

### Connect controls to the action methods in Interface Builder

With the `target` and `action` methods defined, you’re ready to connect them visually to the controls in Interface Builder.

1. Select the control (the `target`) you want to connect to the code (the `action`).

2. Control-drag the control to the view controller in the document outline.

3. Select the action method that the control connects to.

You can verify that the control and action are connected by moving the pointer over the circular dot to the left of the action method. When you do, Xcode highlights the control.

Another way to connect is to Control-drag the control from Interface Builder into the view controller.

Enter the name of the `action` method you’d like the control to call and then click Connect.

The following table lists the parameters available for configuration.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connection | The type of connection to make. Select Action to establish a target-action relationship between the control and the target. |
| Object | The `target` or object your control is connecting to. |
| Name | The name of the function, or `action`, your control calls when the event occurs. |
| Type | The type of the control sending the event. Choose `Any` if you don’t require any further information regarding the control’s state. Specify the control type if you require more information from the control for event processing. |
| Event | The `UIEvent` associated with the action. This feature is only available in UIKit. |
| Arguments | The arguments to include in the signature or your target-action method. Choose None to include no arguments. Choose Sender to pass in the control type as the sender. Choose Sender and Event to pass in both the control type and the event that caused the action. This feature is available only in UIKit. |

Connecting the target-action this way ensures the method signature and parameters are correct as Xcode generates the action method for you.

### Connect a control to your code programmatically

In UIKit, use the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method to set up target-action programmatically on a control:

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
let signInButton = UIButton(type: .system)

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
signInButton.setTitle("Sign in", for: .normal)

// Target-action.
signInButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(buttonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)

view.addSubview(signInButton)
signInButton.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor).isActive = true
signInButton.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor).isActive = true
}

@IBAction func buttonTapped(sender: UIButton) {
print("Sign in successful 🎉")
}
}

#import "ViewController.h"

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
[super viewDidLoad];

UIButton *signInButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeSystem];
[signInButton setTitle:@"Sign in" forState:UIControlStateNormal];

signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false;

// Target-action.
[signInButton addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonTapped:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];

[self.view addSubview:signInButton];
[signInButton.centerXAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerXAnchor].active = true;
[signInButton.centerYAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerYAnchor].active = true;
}

- (void)buttonTapped:(UIButton *)sender {
NSLog(@"Sign in successful 🎉");
}
@end

In AppKit, use the control’s `target` and `action` properties to set target-action programmatically:

import Cocoa

class ViewController: NSViewController {
let signInButton = NSButton()

signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
signInButton.title = "Sign in"

// Target-action.
signInButton.target = self
signInButton.action = #selector(buttonTapped(sender:))

@IBAction func buttonTapped(sender: NSButton) {
print("Sign in successful 🎉")
}
}

#import "ViewController.h"

NSButton *signInButton = [[NSButton alloc] initWithFrame: NSMakeRect(20, 20, 100, 80)];
signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
signInButton.title = @"Sign in";
signInButton.bezelStyle = NSBezelStyleRounded;

// Target-action.
signInButton.target = self;
signInButton.action = @selector(buttonTapped:);

[self.view addSubview:signInButton];
[signInButton.centerXAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerXAnchor].active = YES;
[signInButton.centerYAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerYAnchor].active = YES;
}

- (void)buttonTapped:(NSButton *)sender {
NSLog(@"Sign in successful 🎉");
}

@end

### Enable other objects to respond to control-related events

When the object hosting the control isn’t the one you want handling the event, invoke the responder chain by passing in `nil` as the target. This causes the control to search the responder chain for the specified action method and invoke it when found. For more information, see Using responders and the responder chain to handle events.

# UISegmentedControl

A horizontal control that consists of multiple segments, each segment functioning as a discrete button.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UISegmentedControl

## Mentioned in

Attaching gesture recognizers to UIKit controls

## Overview

A segmented control can display a title (an `NSString` object) or an image ( `UIImage` object). The `UISegmentedControl` object automatically resizes segments to fit proportionally within their superview unless they have a specific width set. When you add and remove segments, you can request that the action be animated with sliding and fading effects.

You register the target-action methods for a segmented control using the `valueChanged` constant as shown below.

segmentedControl.addTarget(self, action: "action:", forControlEvents: .valueChanged)

[segmentedControl addTarget:self\
action:@selector(action:)\
forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

How you configure a segmented control can affect its display behavior:

- If you set a segmented control to have a momentary style, a segment doesn’t show itself as selected (blue background) when the user touches it. The disclosure button is always momentary and doesn’t affect the actual selection.

- In versions of iOS prior to 3.0, if a segmented control has only two segments, then it behaves like a switch — tapping the currently-selected segment causes the other segment to be selected. In iOS 3.0 and later, tapping the currently-selected segment doesn’t cause the other segment to be selected.

### Customize appearance

You can customize the appearance of segmented controls using the methods listed in Customizing appearance. You can customize the appearance of all segmented controls using the appearance proxy (for example, `[UISegmentedControl appearance]`), or just of a single control.

When customizing appearance, in general, you should specify a value for the normal state of a property to be used by other states which don’t have a custom value set. Similarly, when a property is dependent on the bar metrics (on the iPhone in landscape orientation, bars have a different height from standard), you should make sure you specify a value for `UIBarMetrics.default`.

In the case of the segmented control, appearance properties for `landscapePhone` are only respected for segmented controls in the smaller navigation and toolbars that are used in landscape orientation on the iPhone.

To provide complete customization, you need to provide divider images for different state combinations, using `setDividerImage(_:forLeftSegmentState:rightSegmentState:barMetrics:)`:

// Image between two unselected segments.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal,
rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)

// Image between segment selected on the left and unselected on the right.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Selected,
rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)

// Image between segment selected on the right and unselected on the left.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal,
rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Selected, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)

// Image between two unselected segments.
[mySegmentedControl setDividerImage:image1 forLeftSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal\
rightSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:barMetrics];
// Image between segment selected on the left and unselected on the right.
[mySegmentedControl setDividerImage:image1 forLeftSegmentState:UIControlStateSelected\
rightSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:barMetrics];
// Image between segment selected on the right and unselected on the right.
[mySegmentedControl setDividerImage:image1 forLeftSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal\
rightSegmentState:UIControlStateSelected barMetrics:barMetrics];

Attaching gesture recognizers to UIKit controls

Responding to control-based events using target-action

## Overview

As you move the _thumb_ of a slider, it passes its updated value to any actions attached to it. The appearance of sliders is configurable; you can tint the track and the thumb, and provide images to appear at the ends of the slider. You can add sliders to your interface programmatically or by using Interface Builder.

The following image shows the terms used to describe the constituent parts of a `UISlider` object in a left-to-right configuration.

To add a slider to your interface:

- Specify the range of values the slider represents.

- Optionally, configure the appearance of the slider with appropriate tint colors, and limit images.

- Connect one or more action methods to the slider.

- Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the size and position of the slider in your interface.

### Respond to user interaction

Sliders use the target-action design pattern to notify your app when the user moves the slider. To be notified when the slider’s value changes, register your action method with the `valueChanged` event. At runtime, the slider calls your method in response to the user changing the slider’s value.

By default, the slider sends value-changed events continuously as the user moves the slider’s thumb control. Setting the `isContinuous` property to `false` causes the slider to send an event only when the user releases the slider’s thumb control, setting the final value.

You connect a slider to your action method by using the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method or by creating a connection in Interface Builder. The signature of an action method takes one of three forms, as shown in the following code. Choose the form that provides the information that you need to respond to the value change in the slider.

@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UISlider)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UISlider, forEvent event: UIEvent)

- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent*)event;

### Debug sliders

When debugging issues with sliders, follow these tips to avoid common pitfalls:

- **Use either a custom tint color or a custom image, but not both.** When customizing slider appearance with images or tint, use one option or the other, but not both. Conflicting settings for track and thumb appearance are resolved in favor of the most recently set value. For example, setting a new minimum track image for any state clears any custom tint color you may have provided for minimum track images. Similarly, setting the thumb tint color removes any custom thumb images associated with the slider.

- **The current value must be between the minimum and maximum values.** If you try to programmatically set a slider’s current value to be below the minimum or above the maximum, it’s set to the minimum or maximum instead. However, if you set the value beyond the range of the minimum or maximum in Interface Builder, the minimum or minimum values are updated instead.

- **Set custom images for all control states.** If you use custom track and thumb images for your slider, remember to set an image for every possible `UIControl.State`. Any control state that doesn’t have a corresponding custom image assigned to it displays the standard image instead. If you set one custom image, be sure to set them all.

### Configure slider attributes in Interface Builder

The following table lists the core attributes that you configure for sliders in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value Minimum / Maximum | Specifies the values attached to the endpoints of the slider, the minimum representing the leading end of the slider and the maximum representing the trailing end. Access these values at runtime using the `minimumValue` and `maximumValue` properties. |
| Value Current | Represents the initial value of the slider. The value must be between the minimum and maximum values. Access this value at runtime with the `value` property. |

The following table lists the attributes that control the appearance of a slider.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Min Image | Specifies the image displayed at the leading end of the slider. If blank, no image is displayed. Access this value at runtime with the `minimumValueImage` property. |
| Max Image | Specifies the image displayed at the trailing end of the slider. If blank, no image is displayed. Access this value at runtime with the `maximumValueImage` property. |
| Min Track Tint | Specifies the tint color of the track to the leading side of the slider’s thumb. The value defaults to the slider’s inherited tint color. Access this value at runtime with the `minimumTrackTintColor` property. |
| Max Track Tint | Specifies the tint color of the track to the trailing side of the slider’s thumb. Access this value at runtime with the `maximumTrackTintColor` property. |
| Thumb Tint | Controls the tint color of the slider’s thumb. Access this value at runtime with the `thumbTintColor` property. |

The following table lists the attributes that configure the events associated with a slider.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Events: Continuous Updates | Controls when attached actions are triggered: when checked, action events are called whenever the thumb is moved during user interaction. When not checked, attached actions are triggered only on completion of user interaction. Access this value at runtime with the `isContinuous` property. |

For information about the sliders’s inherited Interface Builder attributes, see `UIControl` and `UIView`.

### Customize the slider’s appearance

Use Auto Layout to specify the position and width of a slider. The intrinsic height is determined by the intrinsic heights of the minimum and maximum images, if present. The width of the track automatically adjusts to accommodate the minimum and maximum images.

The most common way to customize the slider’s appearance is to provide custom minimum and maximum value images. These images sit at either end of the slider control and indicate which value that end of the slider represents. Set the values of the `minimumValueImage` and `maximumValueImage` properties to appropriate `UIImage` objects to display images at the ends of the slider. The following image shows a slider configured with minimum and maximum images that imply volume adjustment.

To set custom tint colors for both the track and the thumb of a slider, use the `minimumTrackTintColor`, `maximumTrackTintColor`, and `thumbTintColor` properties, as shown in the following image.

By default, the minimum track tint color defers to the tint color of the slider control.

To completely change the appearance of the slider, you can specify images for the thumb and the track. Provide images for each of the control states (normal, highlighted, and so on) with the `setMinimumTrackImage(_:for:)`, `setMaximumTrackImage(_:for:)`, and `setThumbImage(_:for:)` methods. Set the `capInsets` property for the track images to facilitate horizontal stretching. To access the images used in the current control state, use the `currentMinimumTrackImage`, `currentMaximumTrackImage`, and `currentThumbImage` properties, as shown in the following image.

### Provide localized strings

Sliders have no special properties related to internationalization. However, if you use a slider with a label, make sure you provide localized strings for the label.

Sliders automatically adjust to the appropriate interface direction, ensuring that the minimum end of the slider is always at the leading end and the maximum end at the trailing end. If you override `minimumValueImageRect(forBounds:)` or `maximumValueImageRect(forBounds:)` in a subclass of `UISlider`, be sure to take the user interface layout direction into account.

For more information, see Internationalization and Localization Guide.

### Make sliders accessible

Sliders are accessible by default. The default accessibility traits for a slider are User Interaction Enabled and Adjustable.

"Sound volume: 13 percent. Adjustable. Swipe up or down with one finger to adjust the value."

For more information about making iOS controls accessible, see the accessibility information in `UIControl`. For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

## Overview

By default, pressing and holding a stepper’s button increments or decrements the stepper’s value repeatedly. The rate of change depends on how long the user continues pressing the control. To turn off this behavior, set the `autorepeat` property to `false`.

The maximum value must be greater than or equal to the minimum value. If you set a maximum or minimum value that would break this invariant, both values are set to the new value. For example, if the minimum value is 200 and you set a maximum value of 100, then both the minimum and maximum become 200.

## Mentioned in

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom UIKit view

Adding user-focusable elements to a tvOS app

Adopting system selection UI in custom text views

Customizing Writing Tools behavior for UIKit views

## Overview

You use text fields to gather text-based input from the user using the onscreen keyboard. The keyboard is configurable for many different types of input such as plain text, emails, numbers, and so on. Text fields use the target-action mechanism and a delegate object to report changes made during the course of editing.

In addition to its basic text-editing behavior, you can add overlay views to a text field to display additional information and provide additional tappable controls. You might add custom overlay views for elements such as a bookmarks button or search icon. Text fields provide a built-in overlay view to clear the current text. The use of custom overlay views is optional.

After adding a text field to your interface, you configure it for use in your app. Configuration involves performing some or all of the following tasks:

- Configure one or more targets and actions for the text field.

- Configure the keyboard-related attributes of the text field.

- Assign a delegate object to handle important tasks, such as:

- Determining whether the user should be allowed to edit the text field’s contents.

- Validating the text entered by the user.

- Responding to taps in the keyboard’s return button.

- Forwarding the user-entered text to other parts of your app.

- Store a reference to the text field in one of your controller objects.

For information about the methods of the text field’s delegate object, see `UITextFieldDelegate`.

### Show and hide the keyboard

When a text field becomes first responder, the system automatically shows the keyboard and binds its input to the text field. A text field becomes the first responder automatically when the user taps it. You can also force a text field to become the first responder by calling its `becomeFirstResponder()` method. You might force a text field to become first responder when you require the user to enter some information.

You can ask the system to dismiss the keyboard by calling the `resignFirstResponder()` method of your text field. Usually, you dismiss the keyboard in response to specific interactions. For example, you might dismiss the keyboard when the user taps the keyboard’s return key. The system can also dismiss the keyboard in response to user actions. Specifically, the system dismisses the keyboard when the user taps a new control that doesn’t support keyboard input.

The appearance and dismissal of the keyboard affect the editing state of the text field. When the keyboard appears, the text field enters the editing state and sends the appropriate notifications to its delegate. Similarly, when the text field resigns the first responder status, it leaves the editing state and notifies its delegate. For more information about the sequence of events that occur during editing, see Validate text and manage the editing process.

#### Configure the keyboard’s appearance

You customize your text field’s keyboard using the properties of the `UITextInputTraits` protocol, which the `UITextField` class adopts. UIKit supports standard keyboards for the user’s current language and also supports specialized keyboards for entering numbers, URLs, email addresses, and other specific types of information. You use the properties of this protocol to adjust keyboard traits such as the following:

- The type of keyboard to display

- The autocapitalization behavior of the keyboard

- The autocorrection behavior of the keyboard

- The type of return key to display

#### Respond to keyboard-related notifications

Because the system manages the showing and hiding of the keyboard in response to responder changes, it posts the following notifications for tracking the keyboard-related changes:

- `keyboardWillShowNotification`

- `keyboardDidShowNotification`

- `keyboardWillHideNotification`

- `keyboardDidHideNotification`

- `keyboardWillChangeFrameNotification`

- `keyboardDidChangeFrameNotification`

Each notification contains a `userInfo` dictionary that includes the size of the keyboard. Because the keyboard can hide portions of your interface, you should use the size information to reposition your content on the screen. For content embedded in a scroll view, you can scroll the text field into view, as illustrated in the following image. In other cases, you can resize your main content view so that it isn’t covered by the keyboard.

For more information about managing keyboard interactions, see Text Programming Guide for iOS.

### Format the text in a text field

There are two types of formatting you can do to a text field’s text:

- You can change the font, color, and style of the text using properties of this class. Alternatively, you can specify an `NSAttributedString` for the text field’s content.

- You can format the content of a text field using an `Formatter` object.

The `font`, `textColor`, and `textAlignment` properties, among others, affect the appearance of the text field’s string. Modifying these properties applies the specified characteristic to the entire string. To specify more granular formatting, specify the text field’s text using an `NSAttributedString` object.

The `UITextField` class doesn’t provide built-in support for formatting its string using an `Formatter` object, but you can use the text field’s delegate to format the content yourself. To do so, use the text field’s delegate methods to validate text and to format it appropriately. For example, use the `textField(_:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:)` method to validate and format text while the user is typing. For information about how to use formatter objects, see Data Formatting Guide.

### Use overlay views to edit content

Overlay views are small views displayed on the left and right sides of the text view’s editable area. Typically, overlay views are image-based buttons that you set up as additional editing controls. For example, you might use an overlay view to implement a bookmarks button. To configure a button as an overlay view, specify an image for the button’s content and configure the target and action of the button to respond to taps.

The following code shows how to add a button as the left overlay of a text field. In this case, the code creates a button and configure its size and contents. The `leftViewMode` property specifies when your button is displayed. When the user taps the button, the button calls the configured action method, which in this case is a custom `displayBookmarks:` method.

let overlayButton = UIButton(type: .custom)
let bookmarkImage = UIImage(systemName: "bookmark")
overlayButton.setImage(bookmarkImage, for: .normal)
overlayButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(displayBookmarks),
for: .touchUpInside)
overlayButton.sizeToFit()

// Assign the overlay button to the text field
textField.leftView = overlayButton
textField.leftViewMode = .always

UIButton *overlayButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
UIImage *bookmarkImage = [UIImage systemImageNamed:@"bookmark"];
[overlayButton setImage:bookmarkImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[overlayButton addTarget:self action:@selector(displayBookmarks)\
forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
[overlayButton sizeToFit];

// Assign the overlay button to the text field
self.textField.leftView = overlayButton;
self.textField.leftViewMode = UITextFieldViewModeAlways;

When configuring overlay views, consider whether you want your text field to display the built-in clear button. The clear button provides the user with a convenient way to delete all of the text field’s text. This button is displayed in the right overlay position, but if you provide a custom right overlay view, use the `rightViewMode` and `clearButtonMode` properties to define when your custom overlay should be displayed and when the clear button should be displayed.

### Validate text and manage the editing process

A text field manages the editing of its text with the help of its delegate object. As the user interacts with a text field, the text field notifies its delegate and gives it a chance to control what is happening. You can use the delegate methods to prevent the user from starting or stopping the editing process or to validate text as it’s typed. You can also use the delegate methods to perform related tasks, such as updating other parts of your interface based on the information typed by the user.

For more information about using the text field’s delegate to manage editing interactions, see `UITextFieldDelegate`.

### Interface Builder attributes

The following table lists the attributes that you configure for text fields in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Text | The initial text displayed by the text field. You can specify the text as a plain string or as an attributed string. If you specify an attributed string, Interface Builder provides different options for editing the font, color, and formatting of the string. |
| Color | The color of the text field’s text. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `textColor` property. |
| Font | The font of the text field’s text. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `font` property. |
| Alignment | The alignment of the text field’s text inside the editing area. This option is available only when formatting plain strings. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `textAlignment` property. |
| Placeholder | The placeholder text displayed by the text field. When the text field’s string is empty, the text field displays this string instead, formatting the string so as to indicate that it isn’t the actual text. Typing any text into the text field hides this string. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `placeholder` property. |
| Background | The background image to display when the text field is enabled. This image is displayed behind the rest of the text field’s content. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `background` property. |
| Disabled | The background image to display when the text field is disabled. This image is displayed behind the rest of the text field’s content. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `disabledBackground` property. |
| Border Style | The visual style for the text field’s border. This attribute defines the visual border, if any, drawn around the editable text region. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `borderStyle` property. |
| Clear Button | The behavior of the clear button. The clear button is a built-in overlay view that the user taps to delete all of the text in a text field. Use this attribute to define when the clear button appears. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `clearButtonMode` property. |
| Min Font Size | The minimum font size for the text field’s text. When the Adjust to Fit option is enabled, the text field automatically varies the font size to ensure maximum legibility of the text. You can use this attribute to specify the smallest font size that your consider appropriate for your text. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `minimumFontSize` property. |

The following table lists the keyboard-related attributes that you configure for text fields. This attributes correspond to properties of the `UITextInputTraits` protocol that the `UITextField` class adopts.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Capitalization | The automatic capitalization style to apply to typed text. This attribute determines at what time the Shift key is automatically pressed. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `autocapitalizationType` property. |
| Correction | The autocorrection behavior of the text field. This attribute determines whether autocorrection is enabled or disabled during typing. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `autocorrectionType` property. |
| Spell Checking | The spell checking behavior of the text field. This attribute determines whether spell checking is enabled or disabled during typing. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `spellCheckingType` property. |
| Keyboard Type | The style of the text field’s keyboard. This property specifies the type of keyboard displayed when the text field is active. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `keyboardType` property. |
| Appearance | The visual style applied to the text field’s keyboard. Use this property to specify a dark or light keyboard. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `keyboardAppearance` property. |
| Return Key | The type of return key to display on the keyboard. Use this property to configure the text and visual style applied to the keyboard’s return key. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `returnKeyType` property. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) The return key is disabled by default and becomes enabled only when the user types some text into the text field. To respond to taps in the Return key, implement the `textFieldShouldReturn(_:)` method in the delegate you assign to the text field. |

For information about additional attributes you can configure for a text view, see `UIControl`.

### Internationalization

The default language of the device affects the keyboard that pops up with the text field (including the return key). You don’t need to do anything to enable this functionality; it’s enabled by default. However, your text field should be able to handle input that comes from any language.

When using storyboards to build your interface, use Xcode’s base internationalization feature to configure the localizations your project supports. When you add a localization, Xcode creates a strings file for that localization. When configuring your interface programmatically, use the system’s built-in support for loading localized strings and resources. For more information about internationalizing your interface, see Localization.

### Accessibility

Text fields are accessible by default. The default accessibility trait for a text field is User Interaction Enabled.

For more information about making iOS controls accessible, see the accessibility information in `UIControl`. For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility for UIKit.

### State preservation

When you assign a value to a text field’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it preserves the selected range of text, if any. During the next launch cycle, the text field attempts to restore that selection. If the selection range can’t be applied to the current text, no selection is made. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

Adopting system selection UI in custom text views

## Overview

`UITextView` supports the display of text using custom style information and also supports text editing. You typically use a text view to display multiple lines of text, such as when displaying the body of a large text document.

This class supports multiple text styles through use of the `attributedText` property. (Styled text isn’t supported in versions of iOS earlier than iOS 6.) Setting a value for this property causes the text view to use the style information provided in the attributed string. You can still use the `font`, `textColor`, and `textAlignment` properties to set style attributes, but those properties apply to all of the text in the text view. It’s recommended that you use a text view—and not a `UIWebView` object—to display both plain and rich text in your app.

### Manage the keyboard

When the user taps in an editable text view, that text view becomes the first responder and automatically asks the system to display the associated keyboard. Because the appearance of the keyboard has the potential to obscure portions of your user interface, it’s up to you to make sure that doesn’t happen by repositioning any views that might be obscured. Some system views, like table views, help you by scrolling the first responder into view automatically. If the first responder is at the bottom of the scrolling region, however, you may still need to resize or reposition the scroll view itself to ensure the first responder is visible.

It’s your application’s responsibility to dismiss the keyboard at the time of your choosing. You might dismiss the keyboard in response to a specific user action, such as the user tapping a particular button in your user interface. To dismiss the keyboard, send the `resignFirstResponder()` message to the text view that’s currently the first responder. Doing so causes the text view object to end the current editing session (with the delegate object’s consent) and hide the keyboard.

The appearance of the keyboard itself can be customized using the properties provided by the `UITextInputTraits` protocol. Text view objects implement this protocol and support the properties it defines. You can use these properties to specify the type of keyboard (ASCII, Numbers, URL, Email, and others) to display. You can also configure the basic text entry behavior of the keyboard, such as whether it supports automatic capitalization and correction of the text.

### Keyboard notifications

When the system shows or hides the keyboard, it posts several keyboard notifications. These notifications contain information about the keyboard, including its size, which you can use for calculations that involve repositioning or resizing views. Registering for these notifications is the only way to get some types of information about the keyboard. The system delivers the following notifications for keyboard-related events:

- `keyboardWillShowNotification`

- `keyboardDidShowNotification`

- `keyboardWillHideNotification`

- `keyboardDidHideNotification`

For more information about these notifications, see their descriptions in `UIWindow`.

### State preservation

In iOS 6 and later, if you assign a value to this view’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it preserves the following information:

- The selected range of text, as reported by the `selectedRange` property.

- The editing state of the text view, as reported by the `isEditable` property.

During the next launch cycle, the view attempts to restore these properties to their saved values. If the selection range can’t be applied to the text in the restored view, no text is selected. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

# UISearchTextField

A view for displaying and editing text and search tokens.

@MainActor
class UISearchTextField

## Overview

Use a search text field to display search criteria represented as text and tokens, and allow the user to edit that criteria. Tokens are discrete representations of nontextual content that your app can create and use to represent filters that limit the search results. Tokens always occur contiguously before any text in the search field.

`UISearchBar` hosts a search text field, but you may also use a search text field in other roles, such as the title view of a `UINavigationItem`.

Tokens can be programmatically selected by including their position in a range assigned to the `selectedTextRange` property.

## Topics

### Supporting token interactions

`var allowsDeletingTokens: Bool`

A Boolean that indicates whether the user can remove tokens from the search field.

`var allowsCopyingTokens: Bool`

A Boolean that indicates whether the user can copy or drag tokens from the search field.

`var delegate: (any UITextFieldDelegate)?`

`protocol UISearchTextFieldDelegate`

The interface for the delegate of a search field.

`protocol UISearchTextFieldPasteItem`

A protocol that supports pasting tokens.

### Adding and removing tokens

[`var tokens: [UISearchToken]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisearchtextfield/tokens)

The collection of tokens in the search text field.

`func insertToken(UISearchToken, at: Int)`

Adds a search token at a specific index.

`func removeToken(at: Int)`

Removes a particular search token from the search text field.

### Customizing token behavior

`var tokenBackgroundColor: UIColor!`

The background color for all tokens in the search text field.

Returns the search field’s tokens that are within a given range.

Converts a token index into a text position.

### Providing search suggestions

[`var searchSuggestions: [any UISearchSuggestion]?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisearchtextfield/searchsuggestions)

Search criteria in a search text field, represented by text and an optional icon.

@MainActor
class UISearchToken

## Overview

Use search tokens to help users understand and edit complex search queries in a `UISearchTextField`. A token acts like a single character in standard text interactions such as deleting, selecting, or dragging. A search token should always have text and may also have an icon.

Assign a `representedObject` to each search token that’s meaningful to your app. By attaching this extra data to the token you can reconstruct the full search query using information available in the search field when, for example, your app starts from state restoration or the user starts a search.

See Using suggested searches with a search controller to learn how to use search tokens.

# UIVisualEffectView

An object that implements some complex visual effects.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIVisualEffectView

## Overview

Depending on the desired effect, the effect may affect content layered behind the view or content added to the visual effect view’s `contentView`. Apply a visual effect view to an existing view and then apply a `UIBlurEffect` or `UIVibrancyEffect` object to apply a blur or vibrancy effect to the existing view. After you add the visual effect view to the view hierarchy, add any subviews to the `contentView` property of the visual effect view. Don’t add subviews directly to the visual effect view itself.

### Set the correct alpha value

When using the `UIVisualEffectView` class, avoid alpha values that are less than 1. Creating views that are partially transparent causes the system to combine the view and all the associated subviews during an offscreen render pass. `UIVisualEffectView` objects need to be combined as part of the content they’re layered on top of in order to look correct. Setting the alpha to less than 1 on the visual effect view or any of its superviews causes many effects to look incorrect or not show up at all.

### Use masks with a visual effect view

Masks directly applied to a `UIVisualEffectView` are forwarded to the internal views that provide the visual effect, including the `contentView` itself. You can also apply masks directly to the `contentView`. Applying a mask to a superview of a `UIVisualEffectView` object causes the effect to fail, and an exception is thrown.

Any mask provided to `UIVisualEffectView` isn’t the view that actually performs the mask. UIKit makes a copy of the view and applies it to each subview. To reflect a size change to the mask, you must apply the change to the original mask and reset it on the effect view.

### Capture a snapshot of a visual effect view

Many effects require support from the window that hosts the `UIVisualEffectView`. Attempting to take a snapshot of only the `UIVisualEffectView` results in a snapshot that doesn’t contain the effect. To take a snapshot of a view hierarchy that contains a `UIVisualEffectView`, you must take a snapshot of the entire `UIWindow` or `UIScreen` that contains it.

# UIVibrancyEffect

An object that amplifies and adjusts the color of the content layered behind a visual effect view.

@MainActor
class UIVibrancyEffect

## Overview

A vibrancy effect is intended to be used as a subview of or layered on top of a `UIVisualEffectView` that has been configured with a `UIBlurEffect`. The use of a vibrancy effect can help the content placed inside the `contentView` become more vivid.

The vibrancy effect is color-dependent. Any subviews that you add to the `contentView` must implement the `tintColorDidChange()` method and update themselves accordingly. `UIImageView` objects with images that have a rendering mode of `UIImage.RenderingMode.alwaysTemplate` as well as `UILabel` objects update automatically.

class UIBarButtonItem

## Overview

You typically use Interface Builder to create and configure bar button items. However, you can customize the appearance of buttons by sending the setter messages to `UIBarButtonItemAppearance` to customize all buttons, or to a specific `UIBarButtonItem` instance. You can use customized buttons in standard places in a `UINavigationItem` object or a `UIToolbar` instance.

In general, specify a value for the normal state so that other states without a custom value set can use it. Similarly, when a property depends on the bar metrics (for instance, on the iPhone in landscape orientation, bars have a different height from the standard), specify a value of `UIBarMetrics.default`.

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

A `UINavigationBar` object is a bar, typically displayed at the top of the window, containing buttons for navigating within a hierarchy of screens. The primary components are a left (back) button, a center title, and an optional right button. You can use a navigation bar as a standalone object or in conjunction with a navigation controller object.

A navigation bar is most commonly used within a navigation controller. The `UINavigationController` object creates, displays, and manages its associated navigation bar, and uses attributes of the view controllers you add to control the content displayed in the navigation bar.

To control a navigation bar when using a navigation controller, the following steps are required:

- Create a navigation controller in Interface Builder or in the code.

- Configure the appearance of the navigation bar using the `navigationBar` property on the `UINavigationController` object.

- Control the content of the navigation bar by setting the `title` and `navigationItem` properties on each `UIViewController` you push onto the navigation controller’s stack.

You can also use a standalone navigation bar, without using a navigation controller. To add a navigation bar to your interface, the following steps are required:

- Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the position of the navigation bar in your interface.

- Create a root navigation item to supply the initial title.

- Configure a delegate object to handle user interactions with the navigation bar.

- Customize the appearance of the navigation bar.

- Configure your app to push and pop relevant navigation items as the user navigates through the hierarchical screens.

### Use a navigation bar with a navigation controller

If you use a navigation controller to manage the navigation between different screens of content, the navigation controller creates a navigation bar automatically and pushes and pops navigation items when appropriate.

A navigation controller uses the `navigationItem` property on `UIViewController` to provide the model objects to its navigation bar when navigating a stack of view controllers. The default navigation item uses the view controller’s title, but you can override the `navigationItem` on a `UIViewController` subclass to gain complete control of the navigation bar’s content.

A navigation controller automatically assigns itself as the delegate of its navigation bar object. Therefore, when using a navigation controller, don’t assign a custom delegate object to the corresponding navigation bar.

To access the navigation bar associated with a navigation controller, use the `navigationBar` property on `UINavigationController`. See Customize the appearance of a navigation bar for details on how to customize the appearance of a navigation bar.

For information about navigation controllers, see `UINavigationController`.

### Add content to a standalone navigation bar

In the vast majority of scenarios you use a navigation bar as part of a navigation controller. However, there are situations for which you might want to use the navigation bar UI and implement your own approach to content navigation. In these situations, you can use a standalone navigation bar.

When you use a navigation bar as a standalone object, you’re responsible for providing its content. Unlike other types of views, you don’t add subviews to a navigation bar directly. Instead, you use a navigation item (an instance of the `UINavigationItem` class) to specify what buttons or custom views you want displayed. A navigation item has properties for specifying views on the left, right, and center of the navigation bar and for specifying a custom prompt string.

A navigation bar manages a stack of `UINavigationItem` objects. Although the stack is there mostly to support navigation controllers, you can use it to implement your own custom navigation interface. The topmost item in the stack represents the navigation item whose contents are currently displayed by the navigation bar. You push new navigation items onto the stack using the `pushItem(_:animated:)` method and pop items off the stack using the `popItem(animated:)` method. Both of these changes can be animated for the benefit of the user.

In addition to pushing and popping items, you can also set the contents of the stack directly using either the `items` property or the `setItems(_:animated:)` method. You might use this method at launch time to restore your interface to its previous state or to push or pop more than one navigation item at a time. The following figure shows the part of the `UINavigationBar` API responsible for managing the stack of navigation items.

If you’re using a navigation bar as a standalone object, assign a custom delegate object to the `delegate` property and use that object to intercept messages coming from the navigation bar. Delegate objects must conform to the `UINavigationBarDelegate` protocol. The delegate notifications let you track when navigation items are pushed or popped from the stack. You use these notifications to update the rest of your app’s user interface.

For more information about creating navigation items, see `UINavigationItem`. For more information about implementing a delegate object, see `UINavigationBarDelegate`.

### Customize the appearance of a navigation bar

Navigation bars have two standard appearance styles: white with dark text or black with light text. Use the `barStyle` property to select the style. Any changes you make to other navigation bar appearance properties override those inferred from the bar style.

Navigation bars are translucent by default; their background color is semitransparent. You can make the navigation bar opaque by setting the `isTranslucent` property to `false`.

You can specify a custom tint color for a navigation bar background using the `barTintColor` property. Setting this property overrides the default color inferred from the bar style. As with all `UIView` subclasses, you can control the color of the interactive elements within navigation bars, including button images and titles, using the `tintColor` property.

The `titleTextAttributes` property specifies the attributes for displaying the bar’s title text. You can specify the font, text color, text shadow color, and text shadow offset for the title in the text attributes dictionary using the `font`, `foregroundColor`, and `shadow` keys in Swift and the `NSFontAttributeName`, `NSForegroundColorAttributeName`, and `NSShadowAttributeName` keys in Objective-C, respectively. For more information about string-formatting attributes, see `Character Attributes`.

Use the `setTitleVerticalPositionAdjustment(_:for:)` method to adjust the vertical position of the title. This method allows you to specify the adjustment dependent on the bar height, which is represented by the `UIBarMetrics` enum. The following figure shows a navigation bar with custom tint color, title text attributes, and bar tint color.

To allow complete customization over the appearance of navigation bars, you can additionally provide custom background and shadow images. To provide a custom background image, use the `setBackgroundImage(_:for:barMetrics:)` method, providing a `UIImage` object for the appropriate bar position and metrics values. Use a `UIBarPosition` value for the bar position argument to specify whether to use the supplied image at the bottom or the top of the window, and if it appears at the top, whether to extend it upward under the status bar. Similarly, you can specify that the image should be used for either compact or default bar metrics, with or without a prompt, by providing a `UIBarMetrics` value to the bar metrics argument.

To add a shadow, provide a resizable `UIImage` to the `shadowImage` property. To use the custom shadow image, you need to have specified a custom background image. The following figure shows a navigation bar with a custom background image, supplied using `setBackgroundImage(_:for:barMetrics:)` with a bar position value of `UIBarPosition.topAttached` and a bar metrics value of `UIBarMetrics.default`. A custom image has also been provided to the `shadowImage` property.

To see examples of customizing a navigation bar, see Customizing your app’s navigation bar.

### Customize a navigation bar with Interface Builder

The following table lists the core attributes that you configure for navigations bars in the Attributes Inspector within Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Style | Specifies the UI bar style to apply to the navigation bar. The bar style controls the title color and the bar tint color, but you can override it by providing values for those attributes. Select Translucent to make the navigation bar semitransparent. Access these values at runtime with the `barStyle` and `isTranslucent` properties. |
| Bar Tint | Controls the tint color of the navigation bar. This overrides the value implied by the Style attribute. If the Translucent attribute is selected, the Bar Tint color is automatically made semitransparent. Access this value at runtime with the `barTintColor` property. |
| Shadow Image | Represents the image used as a shadow beneath the navigation bar. This image is stretched horizontally to match the width of the bar. Access this value at runtime with the `shadowImage` property. |
| Back Image | Specifies the image that appears at the leading edge of the back button. This attribute must be used in combination with the Back Mask attribute. Access this value at runtime with the `backIndicatorImage` property. |
| Back Mask | Specifies the mask associated with the Back Image attribute. This is used to control the appearance of the Back button during animated transitions, and therefore must be used in conjunction with the Back Image attribute. Access this value at runtime with the `backIndicatorTransitionMaskImage` property. |

The following table lists the Interface Builder attributes that affect the appearance of the navigation bar’s title.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Title Font | The font used to render the title in the center of the navigation bar. Access this value at runtime with the value stored against the `font` key in Swift or the `NSFontAttributeName` key in Objective-C in the dictionary in the `titleTextAttributes` property. |
| Title Color | The color used to render the navigation bar title. Access this value at runtime using the `foregroundColor` key in Swift or the `NSForegroundColorAttributeName` key in Objective-C in the dictionary in the `titleTextAttributes` property. |
| Title Shadow | Specifies the color and offset of the shadow used when rendering the navigation bar’s title. Access these values at runtime with the dictionary in the \ [`titleTextAttributes`\] property, using the `shadow` key in Swift or the `NSShadowAttributeName` key in Objective-C. |

### Internationalize a navigation bar

To internationalize navigation bars, specify a localized string for each of the displayed string properties of the navigation item model objects.

For more information about internationalizing your interface, see Internationalization and Localization Guide.

### Make a navigation bar accessible

Navigation bars are accessible by default. The default accessibility trait for a navigation bar is User Interaction Enabled.

With VoiceOver enabled on an iOS device, after the user navigates to a new view in the hierarchy, VoiceOver reads the navigation bar’s title, followed by the name of the left bar button item. When the user taps an element in a navigation bar, VoiceOver reads the name and the type of the element; for example, “General back button,” “Keyboard heading,” and “Edit button.”

For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

class UITabBar

## Overview

Typically, you use tab bars in conjunction with a `UITabBarController` object, but you can also use them as standalone controls in your app. Tab bars always appear across the bottom edge of the screen and display the contents of one or more `UITabBarItem` objects. A tab bar’s appearance can be customized with a background image or tint color to suit the needs of your interface. Tapping an item selects and highlights that item, and you use the selection of the item to enable the corresponding mode for your app.

You can configure tab bars programmatically or in Interface Builder. A `UITabBarController` object provides its own tab bar object and you must configure the object provided to you. When creating a tab bar programmatically, use the `init(frame:)` method or another view initializer method to set its initial configuration. Use the methods of this class to configure the appearance of the tab bar. For tab bars you create yourself, you also use the methods of this class to specify the items displayed by the tab bar.

A tab bar reports selections and user customizations to its delegate object. For tab bars you create yourself, use the delegate to respond to selections or to the addition, removal, or reordering of items in the tab bar. (A `UITabBarController` object acts as the delegate for the tab bar it manages.) For more information on implementing a tab bar delegate, see `UITabBarDelegate`.

### Configure the tab bar items

You can configure tab bar items using Interface Builder or create and configure them programmatically in your code. Tab bars in Interface Builder come preconfigured with some initial items and you can add, remove, or reorder items as needed. How you configure items at design time depends on whether your tab bar is associated with a `UITabBarController` object:

- Configuring your tab bar in Interface Builder:

- When a `UITabBarController` object is present, add or remove view controllers to your scene and create relationship segues between the tab bar controller and each new view controller. Creating a relationship segue automatically adds a new item to the tab bar, and deleting an existing relationship segue removes the corresponding tab bar item.

- When a tab bar controller isn’t present, drag tab bar items from the library onto your tab bar.

- Configuring your tab bar programmatically:

- To configure the tab bar associated with a `UITabBarController` object, configure the view controllers associated with the tab bar controller. The tab bar automatically obtains its items from the `tabBarItem` property of each view controller associated with the tab bar controller.

- To configure tab bar items directly, use the `setItems(_:animated:)` method of the tab bar itself.

A tab bar displays all of its tabs onscreen at once, using the `itemPositioning` property to determine how to position items in the available space. If you have more items than can fit in the available space, display only a subset of them and let the user select which tabs are displayed. The `beginCustomizingItems(_:)` method displays an interface for selecting which tab bar items to display.

The contents of each item are stored in a `UITabBarItem` object. Each item contains a title and an image to display in the tab. You can also use tab bar items to add a badge to the corresponding tab. For more information about creating and configuring items, see `UITabBarItem`.

### Respond to tab selections

For tab bars with an associated tab bar controller, the tab bar controller automatically manages selections and displays the appropriate view controller. The only time you have to manage selections yourself is when you create the tab bar without a tab bar controller. The tab bar reports selections to the `tabBar(_:didSelect:)` method of its `delegate` object, which you can use to respond to selection changes. For more information about implementing the delegate object, see `UITabBarDelegate`.

### Configure a tab bar with Interface Builder

The following table lists the attributes that you configure for tab bars in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Discussion |
| --- | --- |
| Background | The background image to display for the bar. If you specify a stretchable image, the image is stretched to fit the available space; otherwise, the image is tiled. When you configure a background image, the tab bar ignores the tint color information. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `backgroundImage` property. |
| Shadow | The custom shadow image for the tab bar. This attribute is ignored if the tab bar does not also have a custom background image. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `shadowImage` property. |
| Selection | The image to use for the selected tab. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `selectionIndicatorImage` property. |
| Image Tint | The tint color to apply to the selected item. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `tintColor` property. |
| Style | The basic style to apply to the bar. You can configure a tab bar with a dark or light style and the bar can be opaque or translucent. To set the style programmatically, use the `barStyle` and `isTranslucent` properties. |
| Bar Tint | The tint color to apply to the bar. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `barTintColor` property. |
| Item Positioning | The positioning scheme to apply to items. Use this attribute to configure how items are spaced across the length of the tab bar. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `itemPositioning` property. |

### Internationalize a tab bar

To internationalize a tab bar, you must provide localized strings for the tab bar item titles.

For more information, see `Localization`.

### Make a tab bar accessible

Tab bars are accessible by default.

With VoiceOver enabled on an iOS device, when a user touches a tab in a tab bar, VoiceOver reads the title of the tab, its position in the bar, and whether it’s selected. For example in the iTunes app on iPad, you might hear “Selected, Audiobooks, four of seven” or “Genius, six of seven.”

For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility for UIKit.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

## Overview

A tab bar item is a segment of a tab bar that represents a specific section of your app. A tab bar displays one or more items that allow the user to switch between the different sections. The user can select one item at a time.

The most common approach for displaying a tab bar is to use a tab bar controller. The controller’s tab bar displays an item for each view controller you provide when you set the `viewControllers` property or call the `setViewControllers(_:animated:)` method. You’re responsible for supplying the tab bar items. Do this by setting each view controller’s `tabBarItem` property. When the user selects an item, the tab bar controller displays its view controller. For more information, see `UITabBarController`.

You can also use a tab bar independent of a tab bar controller. After creating a tab bar, add it to your view hierarchy. Provide the items by setting the tab bar’s `items` property or by using the `setItems(_:animated:)` method. In this configuration, you’re responsible for updating the view hierarchy to display the correct content. Use `UITabBarDelegate` to know when the selection changes. For more information, see `UITabBar`.

The system provides several tab bar items for common use cases. If you need a custom item, create one with a title and an image. You can further customize the item by providing an alternate image that appears when the user selects it. By default, the item doesn’t display the images you provide. Instead, it generates new images from the alpha values of your images and tints them. To prevent this, provide images that use the `UIImage.RenderingMode.alwaysOriginal` rendering mode.

An item can adjust its appearance when in certain conditions. For example, you can specify different appearances for inline and compact inline layouts or for when the item’s state changes. To do this, set the item’s `standardAppearance` property. If you don’t want this behavior, you can set the individual properties on the item instead.

A tab bar item can display a supplementary value in a badge that provides extra information to the user. For example, the Phone app uses a badge’s value to display the number of missed calls. You can customize the badge’s appearance, including its background color and text attributes.

# UIBarPositioning

A set of methods for defining the positioning of bars in iOS apps.

@MainActor
protocol UIBarPositioning : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Bars can be positioned at the bottom of their enclosing view, at the top of their enclosing view, or at both the top of their enclosing view and also the top of the screen. In this last case, the bar will abut the status bar displayed by the system. Bars in this position need to have their background extend above their own frame to the top of the screen. This allows the background to show through the status bar.

The classes that implement bars have paired methods to set a background for a given position and set of metrics. These are named similar to the following: `backgroundImage(for:barMetrics:)` and `setBackgroundImage(_:for:barMetrics:)`. Use these methods to set an appropriate background image for the different possible bar positions and metrics.

- UIKit
- UIEventAttributionView

Class

# UIEventAttributionView

An overlay view that verifies user interaction for Web AdAttributionKit.

@MainActor
class UIEventAttributionView

## Overview

Web AdAttributionKit (formerly known as Private Click Measurement, or PCM) is a proposed web standard that allows external websites to measure when external links, such as ads, result in a _conversion_. The external website decides what constitutes a conversion, but it’s often the result of the user making a purchase or signing up for a service. Web AdAttributionKit doesn’t send any user-identifiable information to the remote server, so it protects user privacy, while providing websites the ability to measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns.

Apps running in iOS 17.4 or later can use AdAttributionKit to record click-through impressions on custom rendered ad content using a `UIEventAttributionView`. For more information about click-through in AdAttributionKit, see Presenting ads in your app.

Apps running in iOS 14.5 or later can take advantage of Web AdAttributionKit by sending event attribution data to the browser when opening an external link. If the linked website reports a conversion within 7 days, the browser forwards your appʼs Web AdAttributionKit data to a specified remote server sometime between 24 and 48 hours after the reported conversion.

You can’t subclass `UIEventAttributionView`.

For more information on the proposed Web AdAttributionKit web standard, see Introducing Private Click Measurement and Private Click Measurement Draft Community Group Report.

### Verify user interaction

Event attribution views overlay other UIKit controls to ensure that either handling a tap with `AdAttributionKit` or opening an external link with Web AdAttributionKit data only happens as the result of a user tap. The system doesn’t handle the tap or send event attribution data to the browser unless a `UIEventAttributionView` exists above the tapped control.

### Create an event attribution view

Place an event attribution view above any view that launches external links with event attribution data and make sure there are no other overlapping views above the event attribution view that might intercept taps. `UIEventAttributionView` doesn’t consume tap events, so the behavior of any control below one in the view hierarchy isn’t affected.

If multiple views or controls in your app can launch an external link using Web AdAttributionKit, use a separate `UIEventAttributionView` to overlay each control. While you can use a single `UIEventAttributionView` to validate more than one control, attribution views that cover large portions of the screen may impact performance because the system must validate all user interactions that pass through the attribution view.

Here’s how to add an event attribution view to an in-app advertisement:

// Create an event attribution view.
let eventAttributionView = UIEventAttributionView()

// Place it over the ad view.
eventAttributionView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
adView.addSubview(eventAttributionView)
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([\
adView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.topAnchor),\
adView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.leadingAnchor),\
adView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.trailingAnchor),\
adView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.bottomAnchor)\
])

// Create an event attribution view.
UIEventAttributionView *eventAttributionView = [[UIEventAttributionView alloc] init];

// Place it over the ad view.
eventAttributionView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
[adView addSubview:eventAttributionView];
[NSLayoutConstraint activateConstraints: @[\
[adView.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.topAnchor],\
[adView.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.leadingAnchor],\
[adView.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.trailingAnchor],\
[adView.bottomAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.bottomAnchor]\
]];

# UIEventAttribution

An object that contains event attribution information for Web AdAttributionKit.

@MainActor
class UIEventAttribution

## Overview

Apps use event attribution objects to send data to the browser when opening an external website that supports Web AdAttributionKit (formerly known as Private Click Measurement, or PCM). For more information on the proposed PCM web standard, see Introducing Private Click Measurement and Private Click Measurement Draft Community Group Report.

You can’t subclass `UIEventAttribution`.

### Define an endpoint

In order to use Web AdAttributionKit, your app defines an `Info.plist` key called `NSAdvertisingAttributionReportEndpoint` that contains the URL to which the browser sends event attribution data. When an externally linked website reports that a conversion has occurred, the browser forwards your app’s event attribution data to the endpoint specified in the `Info.plist`. If your app’s `Info.plist` doesn’t contain this key, the browser won’t be able to forward the Web AdAttributionKit data when a conversion occurs.

Send event attribution data to the browser only when your app opens an external link as a result of a user tapping a control that sits below a `UIEventAttributionView` in the app’s view hierarchy. The event attribution view verifies that the user tapped a control. If that control doesn’t sit below an event attribution view, the system won’t send the Web AdAttributionKit data to the browser when opening the external link.

### Create an event attribution data object

Here’s how you create a `UIEventAttribution` object:

let adURL = URL(string: "https://shop.example/tabletStandDeluxe.html")!
let eventAttribution =
UIEventAttribution(sourceIdentifier: 4,
destinationURL: adURL,
sourceDescription: "Banner ad for Tablet Stand Deluxe.",
purchaser: "Shop Example, Inc.")

NSURL *adURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://shop.example/tabletStandDeluxe.html"];
UIEventAttribution *eventAttribution = [[UIEventAttribution alloc]\
initWithSourceIdentifier:4\
destinationURL:adURL\
sourceDescription:@"Banner ad for Tablet Stand Deluxe."\
purchaser:@"Shop Example, Inc."];

### Send event attribution data to the browser

Once you create a `UIEventAttribution` object, send it to the browser when your app opens a URL as the result of a user tap. If the external website reports a conversion within 7 days, the browser forwards the data from the `UIEventAttribution` object to the specified remote server sometime between 24 and 48 hours after the conversion.

There are two different ways to send event attribution data when your app opens an external link, depending on whether your app uses `UIScene` or `UIApplication` for life cycle management. For more information on application life cycle management, see Managing your app’s life cycle.

If your app uses `UIScene`-based life cycle management, create a `UIScene.OpenExternalURLOptions` object, assign the event attribution object you created to its `eventAttribution` property, and call `open(_:options:completionHandler:)`:

let sceneOpenURLOptions = UIScene.OpenExternalURLOptions()
sceneOpenURLOptions.eventAttribution = eventAttribution

self.view.window?.windowScene?.open(adURL,
options: sceneOpenURLOptions,
completionHandler: nil)

UISceneOpenExternalURLOptions *sceneOpenURLOptions = [[UISceneOpenExternalURLOptions alloc] init];
sceneOpenURLOptions.eventAttribution = eventAttribution;
[self.view.window.windowScene openURL:adURL\
options:sceneOpenURLOptions\
completionHandler:^(BOOL success) {\
if (success == NO) {\
// Handle error\
}\
}];

If your app uses `UIApplication`-based life cycle management, create a dictionary that contains the `eventAttribution` key with the `UIEventAttribution` object you created as its value, and call `open(_:options:completionHandler:)`, passing the dictionary using the `options` parameter.

let appOpenURLOptions: [UIApplication.OpenExternalURLOptionsKey : Any] = [\
.eventAttribution: eventAttribution\
]
UIApplication.shared.open(adURL,
options: appOpenURLOptions,
completionHandler: nil)

[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:adURL\
options:appOpenURLOptions\
completionHandler:^(BOOL success) {\
if (success == NO) {\
// Handle error\
}\
}];

### Send event attribution data to SFSafariViewController

If your app displays a web page in `SFSafariViewController` after a person taps an ad, add a `UIEventAttributionView` subview to the ad view or control in order to measure taps. When a person taps the ad, follow these steps:

1. Create an `SFSafariViewController.Configuration` object.

2. Assign the `UIEventAttribution` object you created to the `eventAttribution` property of the `SFSafariViewController.Configuration` object.

3. Initialize an `SFSafariViewController` instance with the configuration object, and present it. `SFSafariViewController` validates that a tap on a `UIEventAttributionView` initiated the navigation to the webpage. If not, it discards the attribution data.

- UIManagedDocument

Class

# UIManagedDocument

A managed document object that integrates with Core Data.

@MainActor
class UIManagedDocument

## Overview

`UIManagedDocument` is a concrete subclass of `UIDocument`. When you initialize a managed document, you specify the URL for the document location. The document object then creates a Core Data stack to use to access the document’s persistent store using a managed object model from the app’s main bundle. `UIManagedDocument` performs all the basic setup you need for Core Data, and in some cases you may use instances of the class directly (without a need to subclass). You can supply configuration options for the creation of the coordinator using `persistentStoreOptions`, and for the model using `modelConfiguration`. You can also perform additional customization by creating a subclass of `UIManagedDocument`:

- Override `persistentStoreName` to customize the name of the persistent store file inside the document’s file package.

- Override `managedObjectModel` to customize creation of the managed object model.

You do this if, for example, your app supports multiple document types, each of which uses a different model. You want to ensure that the models aren’t merged for each document class.

- Override `persistentStoreType(forFileType:)` to customize the type of persistent store used by a document.

- Override `configurePersistentStoreCoordinator(for:ofType:modelConfiguration:storeOptions:)` to customize the loading or creation of a persistent store.

### Handling errors

To enable your app to observe and handle errors in saving and validating a managed document, you must subclass the `UIManagedDocument` class and override one or both of the following two inherited methods from the `UIDocument` class:

- `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)`

- `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)`

Overriding is required because otherwise, the only information your app receives on error is the `stateChangedNotification` notification, which doesn’t contain a `userInfo` dictionary and so doesn’t convey specific error information.

## Topics

### Managing the Core Data stack

[`func configurePersistentStoreCoordinator(for: URL, ofType: String, modelConfiguration: String?, storeOptions: [AnyHashable : Any]?) throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uimanageddocument/configurepersistentstorecoordinator(for:oftype:modelconfiguration:storeoptions:))

Creates or loads the document’s persistent store.

`var managedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext`

The document’s managed object context.

`var managedObjectModel: NSManagedObjectModel`

The document’s managed object model.

[`var persistentStoreOptions: [AnyHashable : Any]?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uimanageddocument/persistentstoreoptions)

Options used when creating the document’s persistent store.

`var modelConfiguration: String?`

A model configuration name to be passed when configuring the persistent store.

Returns the Core Data store type for a given document file type.

### Customizing read and write operations

`func readAdditionalContent(from: URL) throws`

Handles reading non-Core Data content in the additional content directory in the document’s file package.

Handles writing non-Core Data content to the additional content directory in the document’s file package.

`func writeAdditionalContent(Any, to: URL, originalContentsURL: URL?) throws`

Handles writing non-Core Data content to the document’s file package.

### Naming the persistent store file

`class var persistentStoreName: String`

Returns the name for the persistent store file inside the document’s file package.

# Synchronizing documents in the iCloud environment

Manage documents across multiple devices to create a seamless editing and collaboration experience.

Download

Xcode 12.4+

## Overview

As technology advances, more and more people generate their digital assets from different devices, and expect those assets to synchronize seamlessly. To support such use cases, apps need to discover the assets, as well as their changes, from all the devices, and present the user with a consistent view.

This sample demonstrates how to discover and synchronize documents in the iCloud environment, and manage them to achieve high performance and a low memory footprint. These _documents_ can be the digital assets or any user data.

The sample also demonstrates how to publish an iCloud container to iCloud Drive so that the user can access the container’s `Documents` folder from other apps. Additionally, it shows how to support the Open-in-Place feature, which allows the user to launch an app by tapping a document in Files, and then edit it directly.

### Configure the sample code project

Before building the sample, perform the following steps in Xcode:

1. In the General pane of the `SimpleiCloudDocument` target, update the Bundle Identifier field with a new identifier.

2. In the Signing & Capabilities pane, select the applicable team from the Team drop-down menu to let Xcode automatically manage the provisioning profile. See Assign a project to a team for details.

4. If you prefer to use a different container, select it from the Containers list, specify the container identifier when creating the `MetadataProvider` instance in the `viewDidLoad` method of the `MainViewController` class. An iCloud container identifier is case-sensitive and must begin with “ `iCloud.`”.

5. Find the `NSUbiquitousContainers` entry in the `Info.plist` file, and change the iCloud container identifier there as well.

Before running the sample on a device, configure the device as follows:

1. Log in with an Apple ID. For documents to synchronize across devices, the Apple ID must be the same on all devices.

3. Prepare some pictures in the Photo Library to use in the sample.

### Publish an iCloud container to iCloud Drive

Publishing an iCloud container to iCloud Drive makes the container’s `Documents` folder appear in iCloud Drive so the user can access the folder from other apps. Follow these steps to publish a container:

1. Provide the container’s metadata by adding an `NSUbiquitousContainers` entry to the `Info.plist` file like the example code below demonstrates.

2. Increase the bundle version by changing the Build field in the General pane of the Xcode target, or the `CFBundleVersion` entry in the `Info.plist` file. The new value must be larger than the previous value when using the `compare(_:options:range:)` method with the `NSString.CompareOptions.numeric` option to compare, and must only contain numeric (0 – 9) and period (.) characters. The system only updates an app’s iCloud container metadata when detecting a new version, so perform this step every time the metadata changes.

3. Make sure the `Documents` folder exists in the iCloud container and has at least one document.

The `NSUbiquitousContainers` entry of the sample is as follows:

### Support Open-in-Place

The Open-in-Place feature allows the user to launch an app by tapping a document of the type the app owns. After opening it, the app can change the document directly without copying it to the app’s sandbox container. Follow these steps to implement the feature:

1. Declare and export a document type for the app by adding the `CFBundleDocumentTypes` and `UTExportedTypeDeclarations` `Info.plist` entries. Make sure the type conforms to at least `public.content` and `public.data` in the `UTTypeConformsTo` entry so that the other system components, like `UIActivityViewController`, recognize it.

2. Add the `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` key to the `Info.plist` file, and set the value to `YES`.

3. Implement the `scene(_:openURLContexts:)` method of the `UISceneDelegate` protocol to accept the document.

Apps need to wrap the code that accesses the passed-in URL with the `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource` and `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource` methods if the URL is outside of their sandbox. This sample doesn’t explicitly do that because it accesses the URL via `UIDocument`, which handles security-scoped bookmarks automatically.

### Discover documents in an iCloud container

iOS apps use `NSMetadataQuery` rather than file system APIs to discover documents in an iCloud container. When an app creates an iCloud document on one device, iCloud first synchronizes the document metadata to the other devices to tell them about the existence of the document. Then, depending on the device types, iCloud may or may not continue to synchronize the document data. For iOS devices, iCloud doesn’t synchronize the document data until an app asks (either explicitly or implicitly). When an iOS app receives a notification that a new document exists, the document data may not physically exist on the local file system, so it isn’t discoverable with file system APIs.

To watch the metadata changes in the iCloud container, the sample creates an `NSMetadataQuery` object. It uses the following code to configure and start the query to gather the changes of documents that are in the iCloud container and have an `.sicd` extension name.

metadataQuery.notificationBatchingInterval = 1
metadataQuery.searchScopes = [NSMetadataQueryUbiquitousDataScope, NSMetadataQueryUbiquitousDocumentsScope]
metadataQuery.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "%K LIKE %@", NSMetadataItemFSNameKey, "*." + Document.extensionName)
metadataQuery.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: NSMetadataItemFSNameKey, ascending: true)]
metadataQuery.start()

A query has two phases when gathering the metadata: the initial phase that collects all currently matching results, and a second phase that gathers live updates. It posts an `NSMetadataQueryDidFinishGathering` notification when it finishes the first phase, and an `NSMetadataQueryDidUpdate` notification each time an update occurs. To avoid potential conflicts with the system, disable the query update when accessing the results, and enable it after finishing the access, as the following example shows:

var result = MetadataItem
metadataQuery.disableUpdates()
if let metadatItems = metadataQuery.results as? [NSMetadataItem] {
result = metadataItemList(from: metadatItems)
}
metadataQuery.enableUpdates()
return result
}

### Manage a large data set

Documents in this sample could potentially contain many images, and the images might be large. To load image data only when necessary, and release the data immediately after using it, the `Document` class provides public methods for directly accessing the images in the document package. As an example, the following method retrieves a full image asynchronously:

performAsynchronousFileAccess {
let imageFileURL = self.fileURL.appendingPathComponent(imageName)
let fileCoordinator = NSFileCoordinator(filePresenter: self)
fileCoordinator.coordinate(readingItemAt: imageFileURL, options: .withoutChanges, error: nil) { newURL in
if let imageData = try? Data(contentsOf: newURL), let image = UIImage(data: imageData) {
completionHandler(image)
} else {
completionHandler(nil)
}
}
}
}

When directly manipulating the files in the document package, the sample calls the `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` method to serialize the file access in the background queue, and uses `NSFileCoordinator` to coordinate the reading or writing.

Likewise, to avoid the default implementation that loads image data to `FileWrapper` objects and keeps it in memory, the sample overrides the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method to directly remove or add image files when updating a document.

if saveOperation != .forCreating {
print("\(#function)")
return performAsynchronousFileAccess {
let fileCoordinator = NSFileCoordinator(filePresenter: self)
fileCoordinator.coordinate(writingItemAt: self.fileURL, options: .forMerging, error: nil) { newURL in
let success = self.fulfillUnsavedChanges()
self.fileModificationDate = Date()
if let completionHandler = completionHandler {
DispatchQueue.main.async {
completionHandler(success)
}
}
}
}
}
super.save(to: url, for: saveOperation, completionHandler: completionHandler)
}

### Resolve version conflicts

In the iCloud environment, the user can edit a document from different devices. Depending on networking conditions and the timing of synchronization, that may trigger version conflicts. Apps that provide support for iCloud documents need to resolve these conflicts, and remove the obsolete versions so they don’t consume the user’s iCloud storage.

To create a document conflict with the sample:

1. Run the sample on two iOS devices with Internet connections that use the same Apple ID to log in to iCloud.

2. Create a document with several images on one device, and watch the document synchronize with the other device.

3. Turn on Airplane mode on both devices to disconnect them from the Internet.

4. Change the document on both devices by adding some images on one device, removing some images from the other device, and then saving the changes.

5. Turn off Airplane mode on both devices at the same time to connect them notification, which apps can observe and then implement their conflict resolution strategy.

The sample resolves a conflict by selecting the version that has the most recent `modificationDate` and removing all others. It uses file coordination to assess the version information of an iCloud document to avoid potential conflicts with the system.

DispatchQueue.global().async {
NSFileCoordinator().coordinate(writingItemAt: document.fileURL,
options: .contentIndependentMetadataOnly, error: nil) { newURL in
let shouldRevert = self.pickLatestVersion(for: newURL)
completionHandler?(shouldRevert)
}
}
}

Class

# UIDocumentViewController

A view controller that manages and presents a document stored locally or in the cloud.

@MainActor
class UIDocumentViewController

## Mentioned in

Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience

## Overview

`UIDocumentViewController` presents a view that displays a `document`. It manages opening, saving, and closing the document. You can use `UIDocumentViewController` to present documents from a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, for instance. When you aren’t presenting documents from a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, `UIDocumentViewController` displays a button that, when tapped, presents a picker a person can use to choose the document to display.

The document view controller’s `document` property is an optional `UIDocument`. While the `document` property value is `nil`, the document view controller displays a view depicting an empty state with the message, “No Document”. The empty state provides a prompt that reads “Select a document by tapping the ‘Documents’ button at the top.”

When the `document` property value is not `nil`, the document view controller displays the document. You configure the `view` to display the document in the `documentDidOpen()` callback method.

The navigation item automatically assigns its title menu, its `UIDocumentProperties` object, undo and redo buttons, and `renameDelegate` from information in the document view controller’s `document`.

`UIDocumentViewController` also provides sharing and drag and drop support, and key-commands for common actions such as undo and redo.

### Subclassing notes

`UIDocumentViewController` is an abstract base class that is meant to be subclassed. To create a subclass, you override two methods.

1. The system calls `documentDidOpen()` when someone opens the document associated with the document view controller, or when an object assigns a previously opened document to the document view controller.

2. The system calls `navigationItemDidUpdate()` every time `UIDocumentViewController` makes changes to its navigation item.

#### Open and close documents

When the document view controller opens the document associated with it, or when an object assigns an already opened document to the document view controller, the system calls `documentDidOpen()`. You can populate the view controller’s views to display the content of the document in this method:

override func documentDidOpen() {
configureViewForCurrentDocument()
}

It’s good practice to configure the view in its own method and call that method in both `documentDidOpen()` and `viewDidLoad()`. There is no guarantee of the timing between when the system calls `documentDidOpen()` and when the system loads the view controller’s view, so check that the view loaded and the document opened before configuring your views.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()
configureViewForCurrentDocument()
}

func configureViewForCurrentDocument() {
guard let document = markdownDocument,
!document.documentState.contains(.closed)
&& isViewLoaded else { return }
// Configure views for document
}

#### Customize navigation items

While `UIDocumentViewController` automatically sets the document title and other navigation items using information from the document, you can customize these items by overriding the `navigationItemDidUpdate()` method. The system calls `navigationItemDidUpdate()` every time `UIDocumentViewController` makes changes to the navigation item.

override func navigationItemDidUpdate() {
// Customize the navigation item.
}

#### Add sharing, drag and drop, and undo and redo

`UIDocumentViewController` automatically includes drag and drop, undo and redo, and sharing support. If you want undo and redo buttons to appear in your `UIDocumentViewController`, add a `undoRedoItemGroup` to the navigation bar and ensure that your custom `UIDocument` implements an undo manager. `UIDocumentViewController` sets the `hidden` property of this group, depending on the availability of an undo manager. It automatically enables or disables the buttons inside the group, as necessary.

#### Open a document from outside the class

`UIDocumentViewController` automatically opens and closes its document. However, if you need to access a document from outside the document view controller, you can create a new instance of `UIDocumentViewController` and call its `openDocument(completionHandler:)` method.

In this sample code, a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` presents a document using a `UIDocumentViewController`.

// Open a document.

class BrowserViewController: UIDocumentBrowserViewController {

func presentDocument(_ document: MarkdownDocument) {
let documentController = UIDocumentViewController(document: document)
documentController.openDocument { success in
if success {
self.present(documentController, animated: true)
}
}
}

}

`UIDocumentViewController` makes all the necessary callbacks, such as calling `documentDidOpen()` and, when the document is open, it calls the completion handler you provided.

#### Use the class as a root view controller

`To use a UIDocumentViewController` as the root view controller in an app, you need to declare the key “UIDocumentClass” for the relevant file type in your app’s info.plist. Set the document class to the `UIDocument` subclass you are using in your app.

If there is no browser view controller in the hierarchy, `UIDocumentViewController` displays a document button that opens a document picker in the navigation bar.

Class

# UIPasteControl

A button that a person taps to place pasteboard contents in your app.

@MainActor
class UIPasteControl

## Overview

You can configure the button to appear as an icon, text, or both. The following button represents the icon and text option:

In iOS 16 and later, programmatic pasting raises a user alert that prompts the user for approval before the app gains access to pasteboard contents ( `UIPasteboard.general.string`). Use this class to paste without a user prompt.

### Add a paste button to a text view

The following code displays a paste button and assigns a text view as the recipient of pasteboard contents:

let textView = UITextView(frame: view.bounds)
view.addSubview(textView)

let configuration = UIPasteControl.Configuration()
configuration.baseBackgroundColor = .red
configuration.baseForegroundColor = .magenta
configuration.cornerStyle = .capsule
configuration.displayMode = .iconAndLabel

let pasteButton = UIPasteControl(configuration: configuration)
pasteButton.frame = CGRect(x: view.bounds.width/2.0, y: view.bounds.height/2.0, width: 150, height: 60)
textView.addSubview(pasteButton)

pasteButton.target = textView

Class

# UIPasteboard

An object that helps a user share data from one place to another within your app, and from your app to other apps.

class UIPasteboard

## Overview

For sharing data with any other app, use the systemwide general pasteboard. For sharing data with another app from your team — that has the same team ID as the app to share from — configure an App Group. For more information about configuring an App Group, see Configuring app groups.

In typical usage, an object in your app writes data to a pasteboard when the user requests a copy, cut, or duplicate operation on a selection in the user interface. Another object in the same or different app then reads that data from the pasteboard and presents it to the user at a new location. This usually happens when the user requests a paste operation.

### The general pasteboard and named pasteboards

The system identifies the systemwide general pasteboard with the `general` pasteboard name, and you can use it for any type of data. Obtain the general pasteboard from the `general` shared system pasteboard object.

You can create named pasteboards with the class methods `init(name:create:)` and `withUniqueName()` for sharing data within your app, and from your app to other apps that have the same Team ID.

### Using pasteboards

The `UIPasteboard` class provides methods for reading and writing individual pasteboard items, as well as methods for reading and writing multiple pasteboard items at once. For more information, see Getting and setting pasteboard items in the topic groups below. The data to write to a pasteboard can be in one of the following forms:

- If the data is an object that conforms to `NSItemProviderWriting`, use `setItemProviders(_:localOnly:expirationDate:)` to write it to the pasteboard.

- If you can represent the data with a common object — such as `NSString`, `NSArray`, `NSDictionary`, `NSDate`, `NSNumber`, `UIImage`, or `NSURL` — you can write it to the pasteboard as a value using a method such as `setValue(_:forPasteboardType:)`.

- If the data is binary, use the `setData(_:forPasteboardType:)` method to write it to the pasteboard.

The `UIPasteboard` class provides convenience methods for writing and reading strings, images, URLs, and colors to and from single or multiple pasteboard items. See Getting and setting pasteboard items of standard data types in the topic groups below.

`UIPasteboard` provides properties for directly checking whether specific data types are present on a pasteboard, see Checking for data types on a pasteboard in the topic groups below. Use these properties, rather than attempting to read pasteboard data, to avoid causing the system to needlessly attempt to fetch data before necessary, or when the data might not be present. For example, use the `hasStrings` property to determine whether to present a string-data paste option in the user interface, using code like the following:

if UIPasteboard.general.hasStrings {
// Enable string-related control...
}

Use the following properties to avoid user notifications and alerts when the system doesn’t establish user intent:

- `numberOfItems`

- `types`, `types(forItemSet:)`

- `itemSet(withPasteboardTypes:)`

- `hasColors`, `hasImages`, `hasStrings`, `hasURLs`

- `canLoadObject(ofClass:)`, `canLoadObject(ofClass:)`

- any of the pattern-detection methods in the Detecting patterns of content in pasteboard items group in the topic groups below

The system notifies the user when you access properties or call methods that pull data from the pasteboard if the system doesn’t determine that the user intends to access that data.

### Pasteboard items and representation types

When you write an object to a pasteboard, the pasteboard stores it as a _pasteboard item_. A pasteboard item consists of one or more key-value pairs in which the key identifies the representation type (sometimes called a _pasteboard type_) of the value.

A uniform type identifier frequently functions as the key for a representation type. For example, you can use the `UTTypeJPEG` uniform type identifier (a constant for `public.jpeg`) as a representation type key for JPEG data.

For a discussion of uniform type identifiers, and a list of common ones, see Uniform Type Identifiers.

Your app can use any string to name a representation type; however, for app-specific data types, it’s best practice to use reverse-DNS notation to ensure the uniqueness of the type (for example, `com.myCompany.myApp.myType`).

You can provide flexibility for data sharing by providing multiple representation types for a pasteboard item during a copy or cut operation. Various contexts within your app or other apps can then make use of an appropriate representation type. For example, when a user copies an image, your app can write multiple representation types, such as in the PNG, JPEG, and GIF data formats, to a pasteboard. If the original image is in PNG format, but the receiving app can handle only GIF images, it can still use the pasteboard data.

For more about representation types, read the discussion for the `types` instance method.

### Sharing pasteboards between devices

When a user signs into iCloud, the general pasteboard automatically transfers its contents to nearby devices that use the same iCloud account. You can control Handoff behavior when writing contents to the general pasteboard, and can set an expiration for items, using the `setItemProviders(_:localOnly:expirationDate:)`, `setObjects(_:localOnly:expirationDate:)`, or `setItems(_:options:)` methods, as follows:

- To exclude a pasteboard from Handoff, specify `false` for the `localOnly` parameter, or call the `setItems(_:options:)` method with the `localOnly` option.

- To indicate an expiration time and date for copied data, provide the `expirationDate` parameter, or call the `setItems(_:options:)` method with the `expirationDate` option. At the time and date that you set, the system removes the pasteboard items from the pasteboard.

### Using pasteboards with other objects

Although the `UIPasteboard` class is central to copy, paste, and duplicate operations, you can employ protocols and instances of other UIKit classes in these operations as well, such as the following:

- `UIEditMenuInteraction` — Displays a menu with edit actions, such as Copy, Cut, Paste, Select, and Select All, above or below the selection.

- `UIActivityItemsConfigurationReading` — Objects implement this protocol to indicate that they support copying and sharing data.

- `UIPasteConfigurationSupporting` — Objects implement this protocol to indicate whether they support pasting with a specific `UIPasteConfiguration`.

- `UIResponder` — Responders implement `canPerformAction(_:withSender:)` to enable or disable commands in the above-mentioned menu based on the current context.

- `UIResponderStandardEditActions` — Responders implement methods that this informal protocol declares to handle the chosen menu commands (for example, `copy:` and `paste:`).

A typical app that implements copy, paste, and duplicate operations also manages and presents related selections in its user interface. In addition, your app needs to coordinate changes in pasteboard content with changes to its data model, as appropriate for your app.

# UIActionSheet

A view that presents a set of alternatives for how to proceed with a task.

iOS 2.0–8.3DeprecatediPadOS 2.0–8.3DeprecatedMac Catalyst 13.1–13.1Deprecated

@MainActor
class UIActionSheet

## Overview

In apps that target versions of iOS prior to iOS 8, use the `UIActionSheet` class to present the user with a set of alternatives for how to proceed with a given task. You can also use action sheets to prompt the user to confirm a potentially dangerous action. The action sheet contains an optional title and one or more buttons, each of which corresponds to an action to take.

Use the properties and methods of this class to configure the action sheet’s message, style, and buttons before presenting it. You should also assign a delegate to your action sheet. Your delegate object is responsible for performing the action associated with any buttons when they’re tapped and should conform to the `UIActionSheetDelegate` protocol. For more information about implementing the methods of the delegate, see `UIActionSheetDelegate`.

You can present an action sheet from a toolbar, tab bar, button bar item, or from a view. This class takes the starting view and current platform into account when determining how to present the action sheet. For applications running on iPhone and iPod touch devices, the action sheet typically slides up from the bottom of the window that owns the view. For applications running on iPad devices, the action sheet is typically displayed in a popover that’s anchored to the starting view in an appropriate way. Taps outside of the popover automatically dismiss the action sheet, as do taps within any custom buttons. You can also dismiss it programmatically.

When presenting an action sheet on an iPad, there are times when you shouldn’t include a cancel button. If you’re presenting just the action sheet, the system displays the action sheet inside a popover without using an animation. Because taps outside the popover dismiss the action sheet without selecting an item, this results in a default way to cancel the sheet. Including a cancel button would therefore only cause confusion. However, if you have an existing popover and are displaying an action sheet on top of other content using an animation, a cancel button is still appropriate. For more information, see iOS Human Interface Guidelines.

### Subclassing notes

`UIActionSheet` isn’t designed to be subclassed, nor should you add views to its hierarchy. If you need to present a sheet with more customization than provided by the `UIActionSheet` API, you can create your own and present it modally with `present(_:animated:completion:)`.

@MainActor
class UILocalNotification

## Overview

The operating system is responsible for delivering local notifications at their scheduled times; the app does not have to be running for this to happen. Although local notifications are similar to remote notifications in that they are used for displaying alerts, playing sounds, and badging app icons, they are composed and delivered locally and do not require connection with remote servers.

Local notifications are primarily intended for apps with timer-based behaviors and simple calendar or to-do list apps. An app that is running in the background may also schedule a local notification to inform the user of an incoming message, chat, or update. An app can have only a limited number of scheduled notifications; the system keeps the soonest-firing 64 notifications (with automatically rescheduled notifications counting as a single notification) and discards the rest.

When you create a local notification, you must specify either a specific date or a geographic region as the trigger for delivering the notification. Date-based notifications are delivered at the day and time you specify, and allowances can be made for time zone changes as needed. Region-based notifications are delivered when the user enters or exits the specified region. In both cases, you can specify whether the notifications are one-time events or can be rescheduled and delivered again.

After creating a `UILocalNotification` object, schedule it using either the `scheduleLocalNotification(_:)` or `presentLocalNotificationNow(_:)` method of the `UIApplication` class. The `scheduleLocalNotification(_:)` method uses the fire date to schedule delivery; the `presentLocalNotificationNow(_:)` method presents the notification immediately, regardless of the value of `fireDate`. You can cancel one or more local notifications using the `cancelLocalNotification(_:)` or `cancelAllLocalNotifications()` method of the `UIApplication` object.

When the system delivers a local notification, several things can happen, depending on the app state and the type of notification. If the app is not frontmost and visible, the system displays the alert message, badges the app, and plays a sound—whatever is specified in the notification. If the notification is an alert and the user taps the action button (or, if the device is locked, drags open the action slider), the app is woken up or launched. (If the user taps one of the custom actions you specify using the `category` property, the app is woken up or launched into the background.) In its `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method, the app delegate can obtain the `UILocalNotification` object from the launch options dictionary using the `localNotification` key. The delegate can inspect the properties of the notification and, if the notification includes custom data in its `userInfo` dictionary, it can access that data and process it accordingly. On the other hand, if the local notification only badges the app icon, and the user in response launches the app, the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method is called, but no `UILocalNotification` object is included in the options dictionary. When the user selects a custom action, the app delegate’s `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:completionHandler:)` method is called to handle the action.

If the app is foremost and visible when the system delivers the notification, the app delegate’s `application(_:didReceive:)` is called to process the notification. Use the information in the provided `UILocalNotification` object to decide what action to take. The system does not display any alerts, badge the app’s icon, or play any sounds when the app is already frontmost.

An app is responsible for managing the badge number displayed on its icon. For example, if a text-messaging app processes all incoming messages after receiving a local notification, it should remove the icon badge by setting the `applicationIconBadgeNumber` property of the `UIApplication` object to 0.

When you make this menu visible, `UIMenuController` positions it relative to a target rectangle on the screen; this rectangle usually defines a selection. The menu appears above the target rectangle or, if there isn’t enough space for it, below it. The menu’s pointer is placed at the center of the top or bottom of the target rectangle, as appropriate. Be sure to set the tracking rectangle before you make the menu visible. You’re also responsible for detecting, tracking, and displaying selections.

The `UIResponderStandardEditActions` informal protocol declares methods that are invoked when the user taps a menu command. The `canPerformAction(_:withSender:)` method of `UIResponder` is also related to the editing menu. A responder implements this method to enable and disable commands of the editing menu just before the menu is displayed. You can force the menu commands enabled state to update by calling the `update()` method.

You can also provide your own menu items via the `menuItems` property. When you modify the menu items, you can use the `update()` method to force the menu to update its display.

## Overview

Custom menu items appear in the menu after any validated system items. A `UIMenuItem` object has two properties: a title and an action selector identifying the method to invoke in the handling responder object. Targets aren’t specified; a suitable target is found via normal traversal of the responder chain. To have custom menu items appear in the editing menu, you must add them to the `menuItems` property of the `UIMenuController` object.

## Topics

@MainActor
class UIMutableUserNotificationAction

## Overview

When a notification is delivered, the system displays a button for each custom action associated with the notification. Tapping a button launches your app (either in the foreground or background) and gives you a chance to perform the indicated action. You use this class to configure the details about the button that is displayed and the information your app needs to perform the corresponding action.

To associate custom actions with a local or remote notification, create one or more instances of this class and use them to configure one or more UIMutableUserNotificationActionSettings objects. An action settings objects defines the set of actions to associate with a single notification. You register your app’s action settings objects at launch time, along with your app’s preferred notification options, using a `UIUserNotificationSettings` object.

For each action you define, you must specify whether execution of that action requires the app to be running in the foreground or background. You can also specify whether the device must be unlocked or can remain locked while the action is performed. Unlocking the device may be necessary if the action involves reading or writing files that are encrypted on disk using the system’s data protection mechanism. When the user selects an action, the system puts your app into the appropriate mode and calls your app delegate’s `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:completionHandler:)` or `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:completionHandler:)` method to perform the action.

## Topics

### Getting the action information

`var identifier: String?`

The string that you use internally to identify the action.

`var title: String?`

The localized string to use as the button title for the action.

### Configuring the action’s behavior

`var activationMode: UIUserNotificationActivationMode`

The mode in which to run the app when the action is performed.

`var isAuthenticationRequired: Bool`

A Boolean value indicating whether the user must unlock the device before the action is performed.

`var isDestructive: Bool`

iOS 3.0–8.0DeprecatediPadOS 3.0–8.0DeprecatedMac Catalyst 13.1–13.1Deprecated

@MainActor
class UISearchDisplayController

## Overview

You initialize a search display controller with a search bar and a view controller responsible for managing the data to be searched. When the user starts a search, the search display controller superimposes the search interface over the original view controller’s view and shows the search results in its table view.

In addition to managing the searchable data, the original view controller typically plays four more roles you need to fill when using a search display controller. Those roles are the following:

1. Data source for the search results table view ( `searchResultsDataSource`), which provides the data for the results table.

2. Delegate for the search results table view ( `searchResultsDelegate`), which responds to the user’s selection of an item in the results table.

3. Delegate for the search display controller ( `delegate`), which responds to events such the starting or ending of a search, and the showing or hiding of the search interface. As a convenience, this delegate may also be told about changes to the search string or search scope, so that the results table view can be reloaded.

4. Delegate for the search bar ( `delegate` described in `UISearchBar`), which responds to changes in search criteria.

Typically, you initialize a search display controller from a view controller (usually an instance of `UITableViewController`) that’s displaying a list. See the Simple UISearchBar with State Restoration sample code project for an example of how to configure a search display controller in Interface Builder. To perform configuration programmatically, set `self` for the search display controller’s view controller and search results data source and delegate, as shown here:

searchController = [[UISearchDisplayController alloc]\
initWithSearchBar:searchBar contentsController:self];
searchController.delegate = self;
searchController.searchResultsDataSource = self;
searchController.searchResultsDelegate = self;

If you follow this pattern, then in the table view data source and delegate methods you can check the methods’ table view argument to determine which table view is sending the message:

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {

if (tableView == self.tableView) {
return ...;
}
// If necessary (if self is the data source for other table views),
// check whether tableView is searchController.searchResultsTableView.
return ...;
}

Starting in iOS 7.0, you can use a search display controller with a navigation bar (an instance of the `UINavigationBar` class) by configuring the search display controller’s `displaysSearchBarInNavigationBar` and `navigationItem` properties.

## Topics

### Initializing a search bar

`init(searchBar: UISearchBar, contentsController: UIViewController)`

Returns a display controller initialized with the given search bar and contents controller.

### Displaying the search Interface

`var isActive: Bool`

The visibility state of the search interface.

`func setActive(Bool, animated: Bool)`

Displays or hides the search interface, optionally with animation.

### Configuring a search bar

`var delegate: (any UISearchDisplayDelegate)?`

The controller’s delegate.

`var searchBar: UISearchBar`

The search bar.

`var searchContentsController: UIViewController`

The view controller that manages the contents being searched.

`var searchResultsTableView: UITableView`

@MainActor
class UIUserNotificationAction

## Overview

When a notification is delivered, the system displays a button for each custom action associated with the notification. Tapping a button launches your app (either in the foreground or background) and gives you a chance to perform the indicated action. You use this class to specify the text that is displayed in the button and the information your app needs to perform the corresponding action.

Typically, you create an instance of the `UIMutableUserNotificationAction` class instead of this class. You use the mutable object to configure the action and then call the setActions:forContext: method of UIMutableUserNotificationActionSettings to add the resulting actions to a group.

For each action you define, you must specify whether execution of that action requires the app to be running in the foreground or background. You can also specify whether the device must be unlocked or can remain locked while the action is performed. Unlocking the device may be necessary if the action involves reading or writing files that are encrypted on disk using the system’s data protection mechanism. When the user selects an action, the system puts your app into the appropriate mode and calls your app delegate’s `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:completionHandler:)` or `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:completionHandler:)` method to perform the action.

## Topics

### Creating the action

`init()`

@MainActor
class UIUserNotificationCategory

## Overview

Each instance of `UIUserNotificationCategory` represents a group of actions to display in conjunction with a single notification. The title of each action is uses as the title of a button in the alert displayed to the user. When the user taps a button, the system reports the selected action to your app delegate.

Typically, you create an instance of the `UIMutableUserNotificationCategory` class instead of this class. You use the mutable object to add actions and specify a category name before registering them with a `UIUserNotificationSettings` object.

To display a group of actions for a specific notification, configure the local or push notification with the category name of the group. For local notifications, you specify this name when configuring your `UILocalNotification` object. For push notifications, your server specifies a group of actions by adding a `category` key (whose value is the `identifier` of the group) to the push notification’s payload.

@MainActor
class UIUserNotificationSettings

## Overview

Apps that use visible or audible alerts in conjunction with a local or push notification must register the types of alerts they employ. UIKit correlates the information you provide with the user’s preferences to determine what types of alerts your app is allowed to employ.

Use this class to encapsulate your initial registration request and to view the request results. After creating an instance of this class and specifying your preferred settings, call the `registerUserNotificationSettings(_:)` method of the `UIApplication` class to register those settings. After checking your request against the user preferences, the app delivers the results to the `application(_:didRegister:)` method of its app delegate. The object passed to that method specifies the types of notifications that your app is allowed to use.

In addition to registering your app’s alert types, you can also use this class to register groups of custom actions to display in conjunction with local or push notifications. Custom actions represent immediate tasks your app can perform in response to the notification. You define groups of actions and associate the entire group with a given notification. When the corresponding alert is displayed, the system adds buttons for each action you specified. When the user taps the button for one of the actions, the system wakes your app and calls the `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:completionHandler:)` or `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:completionHandler:)` method of its app delegate. Use those methods to perform the requested action.

@MainActor
protocol UIActionSheetDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

The delegate implements the button actions and any other custom behavior. Some of the methods defined in this protocol are optional.

If you add your own buttons or customize the behavior of an action sheet, implement a delegate conforming to this protocol to handle the corresponding delegate messages. Use the `delegate` property of the action sheet object to specify one of your application objects as the delegate.

If you add your own buttons to an action sheet, the delegate must implement the `actionSheet(_:clickedButtonAt:)` message to respond when those buttons are clicked; otherwise, your custom buttons do nothing. The action sheet is automatically dismissed after the `actionSheet(_:clickedButtonAt:)` delegate method is invoked.

Optionally, you can implement the `actionSheetCancel(_:)` method to take the appropriate action when the system cancels your action sheet. If the delegate does not implement this method, the default behavior is to simulate the user clicking the cancel button and closing the view.

You can also optionally augment the behavior of presenting and dismissing action sheets using the methods in Customizing behavior.

Sample Code

# Implementing Peek and Pop

Accelerate actions in your app by providing shortcuts to preview content in detail view controllers.

Download

Xcode 10.2+

## Overview

This sample project demonstrates previewing content and providing quick shortcuts to functionality using Peek and Pop APIs. The app uses a table view to display a list of colors and tapping any row in the table navigates to a detail view controller showing the color. The app uses 3D Touch on the table view rows to allow users to peek at the content without placing it on the navigation stack.

Colors can also be starred or unstarred. Starred colors are shown with a solid filled colored star icon to the left of the name and unstarred colors have a hollow star. Users can toggle whether a color is starred using one of two methods: they can either tap a button in the navigation bar of the detail view, or use 3D Touch to peek at the content. Swiping up while in 3D Touch lets the user access a Peek Quick Action.

The app uses a tab bar controller to demonstrate two different methods for implementing Peek and Pop. The first tab contains the `ColorsViewControllerStoryboard` view controller, which configures Peek and Pop using the segue in `Main.storyboard`. The second tab contains the `ColorsViewControllerCode` view controller to achieve the same functionality, but in code.

Both `ColorsViewControllerStoryboard` and `ColorsViewControllerCode` are subclasses of `ColorsViewControllerBase`, which contains the implementation of everything necessary to display the table view and handle the standard segue.

### Peek and Pop from a storyboard

The storyboard uses a Show segue with Peek and Pop enabled to navigate from the `ColorViewControllerStoryboard` to `ColorItemViewController`. This is done by selecting the Show segue, and turning on “Preview & Commit Segues” next to Peek & Pop in the Attributes inspector.

When configuring the `ColorItemViewController`, enable the “Use Preferred Explicit Size” option in the View Controller section of the Attributes inspector. Set the “Content Size” to have 0 width and an appropriate height. Zero width configures the view controller to automatically resize to the device width when the user peeks at the content.

When implementing the `ColorsViewControllerBase` view controller, resist the temptation of using either `indexPathForSelectedRow` or `indexPathsForSelectedRows` when preparing to execute a segue. If you configure the storyboard with the default implementation of Peek and Pop, these methods return `nil` at the time of segue execution. Instead, use the segue’s `sender` property to access the cell initiating the peek.

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
guard let selectedTableViewCell = sender as? UITableViewCell,
let indexPath = tableView.indexPath(for: selectedTableViewCell)
else { preconditionFailure("Expected sender to be a valid table view cell") }

guard let colorItemViewController = segue.destination as? ColorItemViewController
else { preconditionFailure("Expected a ColorItemViewController") }

// Pass over a reference to the ColorData object and the specific ColorItem being viewed.
colorItemViewController.colorData = colorData
colorItemViewController.colorItem = colorData.colors[indexPath.row]
}

### Peek and Pop in code

The `ColorsViewControllerCode` view controller adds code to manually register for Peek and Pop instead of using the storyboard to customize the segue. Call `registerForPreviewing(with:sourceView:)` to register a class which implements the `UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate` protocol, and then pass in a view which responds to the 3D Touch.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

registerForPreviewing(with: self, sourceView: tableView)
}

The protocol requires the implementation of two methods. When the system detects the 3D Touch, it calls `previewingContext(_:viewControllerForLocation:)`, passing a `previewingContext` object that conforms to the `UIViewControllerPreviewing` protocol. Use this method to configure and pass back a view controller for the peek.

// First, get the index path and view for the previewed cell.
guard let indexPath = tableView.indexPathForRow(at: location),
let cell = tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)
else { return nil }

// Enable blurring of other UI elements, and a zoom in animation while peeking.
previewingContext.sourceRect = cell.frame

// Create and configure an instance of the color item view controller to show for the peek.
guard let viewController = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "ColorItemViewController") as? ColorItemViewController
else { preconditionFailure("Expected a ColorItemViewController") }

// Pass over a reference to the ColorData object and the specific ColorItem being viewed.
viewController.colorData = colorData
viewController.colorItem = colorData.colors[indexPath.row]

return viewController
}

When the system detects enough pressure in the 3D Touch to pop the view controller, it calls `previewingContext(_:commit:)`. Take the passed in view controller and present to the user.

func previewingContext(_ previewingContext: UIViewControllerPreviewing, commit viewControllerToCommit: UIViewController) {
// Push the configured view controller onto the navigation stack.
navigationController?.pushViewController(viewControllerToCommit, animated: true)
}

### Implement Peek Quick Actions

To enable Peek Quick Actions for the `ColorItemViewController`, you must override the default implementation of the `previewActionItems` property to return an array of `UIPreviewAction` or `UIPreviewActionGroup` objects.

Both a star/unstar action and a delete action are available as quick actions using the following code:

override var previewActionItems: [UIPreviewActionItem] {
let starAction = UIPreviewAction(title: starButtonTitle(), style: .default, handler: { [unowned self] (_, _) in
guard let colorItem = self.colorItem
else { preconditionFailure("Expected a color item") }

colorItem.starred.toggle()
})

let deleteAction = UIPreviewAction(title: "Delete", style: .destructive) { [unowned self] (_, _) in
guard let colorData = self.colorData
else { preconditionFailure("Expected a reference to the color data container") }

guard let colorItem = self.colorItem
else { preconditionFailure("Expected a color item") }

colorData.delete(colorItem)
}

return [ starAction, deleteAction ]
}

The star/unstar action is shown with a default style and the delete action is shown as being destructive.

It’s important to ensure that your app’s features are still available to devices that do not support 3D Touch. In this sample, both the star/unstar and the delete functionality remain available by navigating into the `ColorItemViewController` and tapping buttons in the navigation bar. The Peek Quick Action provides a more convenient way to access that feature.

`case always`

Always defer focus for this item, even if deferral is disabled right now. This means a programmatic update to this item would result in focus disappearing until the user interacts with the focus engine again.

`case automatic`

Use the system default behavior.

`case never`

Never defer focus for this item. When a programmatic focus update lands on this item, it will always be and appear focused even if focus deferral is currently enabled.

Class

# UIDocumentBrowserViewController

A view controller for browsing and performing actions on documents that you store locally and in the cloud.

@MainActor
class UIDocumentBrowserViewController

## Mentioned in

Providing access to directories

Customizing the browser

## Overview

With the document browser view controller, users can easily access and view their documents in the cloud. By default, the document browser can access both the system’s local file provider and its iCloud file provider.

The local file provider grants access to all the documents in the app’s `Documents` directory. Users can also access documents from another app’s `Documents` directory, if that app declares either the `UISupportsDocumentBrowser` key, or both the `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` keys in its `Info.plist` file. When the user opens a document from another app’s `Documents` directory, they edit the document in place, and save the changes to the other app’s `Documents` directory.

The iCloud file provider creates a folder for your app in the user’s iCloud Drive. Users can access documents from this folder, or from anywhere in their iCloud Drive. The system automatically handles access to iCloud for you, so you don’t need to enable your app’s iCloud capabilities.

Third-party storage services can also provide access to the documents they manage by implementing a File Provider extension (iOS 11 or later). For more information, see File Provider.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/init(fileurl:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- init(fileURL:)

Initializer

# init(fileURL:)

Returns a document object initialized with its file-system location.

@MainActor
init(fileURL url: URL)

## Parameters

`url`

A file URL identifying the location in the application sandbox where document data is to be written. Passing in `nil` or an empty URL results in the throwing of an `invalidArgumentException`.

## Return Value

A `UIDocument` object or `nil` if the object could not be created.

## Discussion

After you create a document object and no file exists for it yet, you should next call the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` to write the document to its file-system location in the application sandbox. If `url` locates an existing document file, call `open(completionHandler:)` after creating the document object. The second parameter of this method, the save operation constant, should be `UIDocument.SaveOperation.forCreating` when there is no document file yet. In the completion handler, if you want the document to be automatically synced with other devices you should ensure that its URL is based in a ubiquitous container; see Designing for Documents in iCloud for more information.

## See Also

### Related Documentation

`var fileURL: URL`

The file URL you use to initialize the document.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/filetype

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- fileType

Instance Property

# fileType

The file type of the document.

@MainActor
var fileType: String? { get }

## Discussion

The file type is a uniform type identifier (UTI). UIKit derives the UTI from the filename-extension component of `fileURL`.

UIKit sets this property before it calls the completion handlers of the `open(completionHandler:)`, `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`, and `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)`. If, outside of these methods or their completion handlers, you want to wait for any pending file operations to complete before you access this property, you can call `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` and access the property value in the block parameter.

## See Also

### Accessing document attributes

`var fileURL: URL`

The file URL you use to initialize the document.

`var localizedName: String`

The localized name of the document.

`var fileModificationDate: Date?`

The date and time your app last modified the document file.

`var documentState: UIDocument.State`

The current state of the document.

`var progress: Progress?`

The upload or download progress of a document.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/localizedname

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- localizedName

Instance Property

# localizedName

The localized name of the document.

@MainActor
var localizedName: String { get }

## Discussion

By default, UIKit obtains the value from the filename component of `fileURL`. You can override the getter accessor method of this property to provide a custom name for presentation to the user, such as in error strings. See `UIDocument` for overriding advice.

UIKit sets this property before it calls the completion handlers of the `open(completionHandler:)`, `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`, and `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)`. If, outside of these methods or their completion handlers, you want to wait for any pending file operations to complete before you access this property, you can call `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` and access the property value in the block parameter.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/save(to:for:completionhandler:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- save(to:for:completionHandler:)

Instance Method

# save(to:for:completionHandler:)

Saves document data to the specified location in the application sandbox.

@MainActor
func save(
to url: URL,
for saveOperation: UIDocument.SaveOperation,

)
@MainActor
func save(
to url: URL,
for saveOperation: UIDocument.SaveOperation

## Parameters

`url`

The file URL identifying the location in the application sandbox to write the document data to. Typically, this is the URL obtained from the `fileURL` property.

`saveOperation`

A constant that indicates whether the document file is being written the first time or whether it is being overwritten. See `UIDocument.SaveOperation` for details.

`completionHandler`

A block with code that is executed when the save operation concludes. The block returns no value and has one parameter:

`success`

`true` if the save operation succeeds, otherwise `false`.

This block is invoked on the calling queue.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method first calls the `contents(forType:)` method synchronously on the calling queue to get the document data to save. Then it calls the `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` method on a background queue to perform the actual writing of the data to disk.

If you override this method, it’s recommended that you first call the superclass implementation of the method ( `super`). If you do not call `super`, you must do two things:

- Call `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` to put the save operation on a background queue.

- In the block parameter, implement coordinated writing by using the `NSFileCoordinator` class.

- From within the coordinated write, call `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)`.

## See Also

### Writing document data

Asynchronously closes the document after saving any changes.

Returns the document data to be saved.

[`func writeContents(Any, andAttributes: [AnyHashable : Any]?, safelyTo: URL, for: UIDocument.SaveOperation) throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/writecontents(_:andattributes:safelyto:for:))

Ensures that document data is written safely to a specified location in the application sandbox.

`func writeContents(Any, to: URL, for: UIDocument.SaveOperation, originalContentsURL: URL?) throws`

Writes the document data to disk at the sandbox location indicated by a file URL.

`var savingFileType: String?`

Returns the file type to use for saving a document.

Returns a dictionary of file attributes to associate with the document file when writing or updating it.

Returns a file extension to append to the file URL of the document file being written.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/open(completionhandler:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- open(completionHandler:)

Instance Method

# open(completionHandler:)

Opens a document asynchronously.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`completionHandler`

A block with code to execute after the open operation concludes. The block returns no value and has one parameter:

`success`

`true` if the open operation succeeds, otherwise `false`.

The block is invoked on the main queue.

## Discussion

Call this method to begin the sequence of method calls that opens and reads a document asynchronously. The method obtains the file-system location of the document from the `fileURL` property. After the open operation concludes, the code in `completionHandler` is executed.

You can override this method if you want custom document-opening behavior, but if you do it’s recommended that you call the superclass implementation first ( `super`). If you don’t call `super`, you should use the `NSFileCoordinator` class to implement coordinated reading. The default implementation calls `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` to schedule the document-reading work for execution on a background queue and then, from the dispatched block, performs file coordination. The queued task then calls `read(from:)`.

## See Also

### Reading document data

`func load(fromContents: Any, ofType: String?) throws`

Loads the document data into the app’s data model.

`func read(from: URL) throws`

Reads the document data in a file at a specified location in the application sandbox.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/close(completionhandler:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- close(completionHandler:)

Instance Method

# close(completionHandler:)

Asynchronously closes the document after saving any changes.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`completionHandler`

A block with code to execute after the save-and-close operation concludes. The block returns no value and has one parameter:

`success`

`true` if any save operation succeeds, otherwise `false`.

The block is invoked on the main queue.

## Discussion

You call this method to begin the sequence of method calls that saves a document safely and asynchronously. The file-system location of the document derives from the `fileURL` property. After the save operation concludes, the code in `completionHandler` is executed. In this code, you can close the document — for example, by removing the document’s view from the screen. Additionally, if the save operation didn’t succeed ( `success` is `false`), you can respond in an appropriate manner.

You typically wouldn’t override this method. The default implementation calls the `autosave(completionHandler:)` method.

## See Also

### Writing document data

Returns the document data to be saved.

Saves document data to the specified location in the application sandbox.

[`func writeContents(Any, andAttributes: [AnyHashable : Any]?, safelyTo: URL, for: UIDocument.SaveOperation) throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/writecontents(_:andattributes:safelyto:for:))

Ensures that document data is written safely to a specified location in the application sandbox.

`func writeContents(Any, to: URL, for: UIDocument.SaveOperation, originalContentsURL: URL?) throws`

Writes the document data to disk at the sandbox location indicated by a file URL.

`var savingFileType: String?`

Returns the file type to use for saving a document.

Returns a dictionary of file attributes to associate with the document file when writing or updating it.

Returns a file extension to append to the file URL of the document file being written.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/performasynchronousfileaccess(_:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- performAsynchronousFileAccess(\_:)

Instance Method

# performAsynchronousFileAccess(\_:)

Schedules a document-reading or document-writing operation on a concurrent background queue.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`block`

A block that’s invoked as the task to execute on the background queue. The block returns no value and takes no parameters.

## Discussion

A typical `UIDocument` subclass — one that overrides `contents(forType:)` and `load(fromContents:ofType:)` — doesn’t need to call this method.

The default implementations of `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` and `open(completionHandler:)` call this method to serialize file access. If you override these methods and don’t call `super`, you should call this method to serialize file access on a background queue. If you directly call the `read(from:)` method, you should wrap that call in the block passed into `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)`.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/revert(tocontentsof:completionhandler:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)

Instance Method

# revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)

Reverts a document to the most recent document data stored on-disk.

@MainActor
func revert(
toContentsOf url: URL,

)
@MainActor

## Parameters

`url`

A file URL locating the most recent version of the document file in the application’s sandbox.

`completionHandler`

A block with code to execute after the reversion operation concludes. The block returns no value and has one parameter:

`success`

`true` if the reversion operation succeeds, otherwise `false`.

The block is invoked on the main queue.

## Discussion

You call this method to discard all unsaved document modifications and replace the document’s contents by reading the file or file package located by `url`. The default implementation brackets the reversion operation between `disableEditing()` and `enableEditing()` because the document shouldn’t accept user changes during this period. Subclasses that override this method must call the superclass implementation ( `super`) or use the `NSFileCoordinator` class to initiate a coordinated read.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/fileurl

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- fileURL

Instance Property

# fileURL

The file URL you use to initialize the document.

@MainActor
var fileURL: URL { get }

## Discussion

The URL identifies the location of the document in the application sandbox. It includes the file extension, from which the file type is determined.

UIKit sets this property before it calls the completion handlers of the `open(completionHandler:)`, `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`, and `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)`. If, outside of these methods or their completion handlers, you want to wait for any pending file operations to complete before you access this property, you can call `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` and access the property value in the block parameter.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/load(fromcontents:oftype:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- load(fromContents:ofType:)

Instance Method

# load(fromContents:ofType:)

Loads the document data into the app’s data model.

@MainActor
func load(
fromContents contents: Any,
ofType typeName: String?
) throws

## Parameters

`contents`

An object encapsulating the document data to load. This object is either an instance of the `NSData` class (for flat files) or the `FileWrapper` class (for file packages).

`typeName`

The file type of the document, a Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) based on the file extension of `fileURL`. You can obtain the default value of the file type from the `fileType` property.

## Discussion

Override this method to accept and load the data for a document. After `UIDocument` reads the document data from the file located at `fileURL` it calls your subclass, passing the data to the subclass in this method. This method is called on the queue that the `open(completionHandler:)` method was called on (typically, the main queue).

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/hasunsavedchanges

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- hasUnsavedChanges

Instance Property

# hasUnsavedChanges

A Boolean value that indicates whether the document has any unsaved changes.

@MainActor
var hasUnsavedChanges: Bool { get }

## Return Value

`true` if the document has unsaved changes, otherwise `false`.

## Discussion

The default implementation of `autosave(completionHandler:)` initiates a save if this property returns `true`. Typical subclasses don’t need to override `hasUnsavedChanges`. To implement change tracking, they should instead use an `UndoManager` object (assigned to `undoManager`) to register changes or call `updateChangeCount(_:)` every time the user makes a change; UIKit then automatically determines whether there are unsaved changes.

## See Also

### Tracking changes and autosaving

`func updateChangeCount(UIDocument.ChangeKind)`

Updates the change counter by indicating the kind of change.

`var undoManager: UndoManager!`

The undo manager for the document.

Returns a change token for a specific save operation.

`func updateChangeCount(withToken: Any, for: UIDocument.SaveOperation)`

Updates the change count with reference to a change-count token passed in by UIKit.

Initiates automatic saving of documents with unsaved changes.

---

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/undomanager

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- undoManager

Instance Property

# undoManager

The undo manager for the document.

@MainActor
var undoManager: UndoManager! { get set }

## Discussion

This property holds the document’s undo manager (an `UndoManager` object). Accessing this property lazily creates a default undo manager if a custom undo manager hasn’t been set.

The undo manager for the document is registered as an observer of various `UndoManager` notifications so that it can call `updateChangeCount(_:)` as the user makes undoable changes to the document. When a subclass sets this property and implements registers changes with it, it doesn’t need to call `updateChangeCount(_:)` directly or (more rarely) override `hasUnsavedChanges`.

## See Also

`var hasUnsavedChanges: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the document has any unsaved changes.

`func updateChangeCount(UIDocument.ChangeKind)`

@MainActor
func updateChangeCount(_ change: UIDocument.ChangeKind)

## Parameters

`change`

A constant that indicates whether a change has been made, cleared, undone, or redone. See `UIDocument.ChangeKind` for more information.

## Discussion

Calling this method can affect the value returned by `hasUnsavedChanges`. You shouldn’t need to call method this if you access an `UndoManager` object from the `undoManager` property (or assign a custom one to it) and register changes with the undo manager.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/handleerror(_:userinteractionpermitted:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- handleError(\_:userInteractionPermitted:)

Instance Method

# handleError(\_:userInteractionPermitted:)

Handles an error that occurs during an attempt to read, save, or revert a document.

@MainActor
func handleError(
_ error: any Error,
userInteractionPermitted: Bool
)

## Parameters

`error`

An object encapsulating information about an error encountered in an attempt to open, save, or revert a document. The error domain is `NSCocoaErrorDomain`. The error code is one of the `enum` constants declared in `FoundationErrors.h`.

`userInteractionPermitted`

If `false`, no attempt is (or should be) made to present a modal view to the user. This value can be `false` in cases such as when a save operation fails while the application is being suspended. If this parameter is `true`, UIKit or your override may present error information to the user in a modal view and (optionally) allow the user to resolve the error.

## Discussion

Typical `UIDocument` subclasses don’t need to call or override this method. Instead, they can observe the `stateChangedNotification` notification to be notified of changes in document state. In their notification handler, they can check the value of the `documentState` property and proceed accordingly. See Resolve conflicts and handle errors for a discussion of this.

If you’re using managed documents (instances of the `UIManagedDocument` subclass), you must subclass this method and, if desired, the `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)` method. Subclassing allows your app to observe errors in saving or validation. The `stateChangedNotification` notification doesn’t contain a `userInfo` dictionary and so doesn’t convey specific error information.

If you directly call any of the advanced reading and writing methods that have an error-object parameter (for example, `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)`) and that call returns an `NSError` object by indirection, you should call this method ( `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)`), passing in the error object.

This method is called by the default implementations of `open(completionHandler:)` and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` when `UIDocument` encounters a reading or writing error, respectively.

If you override this method and don’t invoke the superclass implementation ( `super`), you’re responsible for the following:

- Calling `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)` when you’re finished handling the error — for example, when the application doesn’t require any additional user feedback about the error.

- Implementing `userInteractionNoLongerPermitted(forError:)` to conclude error handling immediately. If `userInteractionPermitted` is `false`, you should immediately handle the error and call `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)` within the context of the `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)`.

## See Also

### Resolving conflicts and handling errors

`func finishedHandlingError(any Error, recovered: Bool)`

Tells UIKit that you finished handling the error.

`func userInteractionNoLongerPermitted(forError: any Error)`

Indicates when it’s no longer safe to proceed without immediately handling the error.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/read(from:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- read(from:)

Instance Method

# read(from:)

Reads the document data in a file at a specified location in the application sandbox.

@MainActor
func read(from url: URL) throws

## Parameters

`url`

A file URL that identifies the location of the document file in the application sandbox. This file URL is typically the one returned by the `fileURL` property.

## Discussion

Typical `UIDocument` subclasses shouldn’t need to call this method directly, especially if the entire file is read at once. The default implementation calls `load(fromContents:ofType:)` on the queue on which `open(completionHandler:)` was called to provide the `UIDocument` subclass with the document data object.

Subclasses that want more control over the reading of the document file—for example, that want to read a large document file incrementally—can override this method. It isn’t necessary for these subclasses to call the superclass implementation ( `super`).

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/writecontents(_:to:for:originalcontentsurl:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIDocument
- writeContents(\_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)

Instance Method

# writeContents(\_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)

Writes the document data to disk at the sandbox location indicated by a file URL.

@MainActor
func writeContents(
_ contents: Any,
to url: URL,
for saveOperation: UIDocument.SaveOperation,
originalContentsURL: URL?
) throws

## Parameters

`contents`

The document data to write to disk. Typically, the data is encapsulated by an `NSData` object (if a flat file) or an `FileWrapper` object (if a file package).

If the object encapsulating the document data is of some other type, you should override this method or `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` to perform the actual writing of the data.

`url`

A file URL specifying the location of the document file in the application sandbox.

`saveOperation`

A constant that indicates whether the document file is being written the first time or whether it is being overwritten. See `UIDocument.SaveOperation` for details.

`originalContentsURL`

A file URL specifying the previous location of the document file (if not `nil`).

## Discussion

This method is called by the `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` to write the actual file data. It is passed the contents object returned from your `contents(forType:)` implementation. The default implementation of this method supports `NSData` or `FileWrapper` contents by asking the contents object to save itself to the corresponding URL.

If you override this method, you may choose to return a different type of data from `contents(forType:)` or you may choose to not override `contents(forType:)` and generate the writable data directly within this method. If you override this method, you should not invoke the superclass implementation.

@MainActor
func writeContents(
_ contents: Any,
andAttributes additionalFileAttributes: [AnyHashable : Any]? = nil,
safelyTo url: URL,
for saveOperation: UIDocument.SaveOperation
) throws

## Parameters

`contents`

The document data to write to disk. Typically, the data is encapsulated by an `NSData` object (if a flat file) or an `FileWrapper` object (if a file package).

If the object encapsulating the document data is of some other type, you should override this method or `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` to perform the actual writing of the data.

`additionalFileAttributes`

A dictionary of `FileManager` file attributes to assign to the document file. The default implementation obtains these file attributes by calling `fileAttributesToWrite(to:for:)`.

`url`

The file URL specifying the location of the document file in the application sandbox.

`saveOperation`

A constant that indicates whether the document file is being written the first time or whether it is being overwritten. See `UIDocument.SaveOperation` for details.

## Discussion

This method is called by the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method to save the file data (and associated attributes in the case of an `FileWrapper`). It creates temporary files and directories as necessary so that successful saves can be completed atomically and failed saves can be rolled back cleanly. This method calls `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` to save the `contents` object, passing the location for the new saved file in the `toURL` parameter and the location of the previously existing file in the `originalContentsURL` parameter, if this is an overwrite operation.

If you want to change how file data is saved, you generally override the `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` method instead of this method. Additionally, you don’t need to call this method directly unless you are overriding the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method.

## Return Value

A Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) identifying a document type (for example, PDF or HTML).

## Discussion

The default implementation returns the current file type obtained from the `fileType` property. The default implementation of the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method appends an extension to the file URL that’s based on the file type. So if you want to move the document to a new type and extension, you can override this method to supply that file type.

Protocol

# UINavigationItemRenameDelegate

Methods an object implements to rename a navigation item.

## Overview

A navigation item ( `UINavigationItem`) uses this delegate to determine whether a person can change the navigation item’s title and to handle the rename process.

## Topics

### Determining rename support

`- navigationItemShouldBeginRenaming:`

Asks the delegate whether the navigation item supports renaming.

`- navigationItem:shouldEndRenamingWithTitle:`

Asks the delegate whether to continue or abandon the rename process.

### Handling the rename process

`- navigationItem:willBeginRenamingWithSuggestedTitle:selectedRange:`

Tells the delegate when the rename process starts.

`- navigationItem:didEndRenamingWithTitle:`

Tells the delegate when the rename process ends.

Instance Property

# renameDelegate

The delegate for renaming the navigation item.

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Discussion

If you assign a non- `nil` value to this property, UIKit shows an inline text field UI for changing the navigation item’s title. This UI appears when either you or the system calls `rename(_:)` on the navigation controller, which occurs when a person taps Rename in the title menu or when you call `rename(_:)` explicitly.

To show Rename in the navigation item’s title menu, include the Rename menu element in the menu you return from `titleMenuProvider`. UIKit includes Rename in the set of menu element suggestions it passes in to this closure.

If you only want to show Rename in the title menu, assign a `renameDelegate` without setting a `titleMenuProvider`. In this case, UIKit automatically generates a title menu containing the Rename menu element only.

If you set this property to `nil` while a rename operation is in progress, the operation cancels immediately.

Instance Property

# fileModificationDate

The date and time your app last modified the document file.

@MainActor
var fileModificationDate: Date? { get set }

## Discussion

The modification date is updated by the `open(completionHandler:)`, `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`, and `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)` methods. Its value is `nil` if none of these methods has completed successfully at least once. If you override any of these methods, you should be sure to set this property in your implementation.

UIKit sets this property before it calls the completion handlers of the `open(completionHandler:)`, `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`, and `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)`. If, outside of these methods or their completion handlers, you want to wait for any pending file operations to complete before you access this property, you can call `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` and access the property value in the block parameter.

Instance Method

# changeCountToken(for:)

Returns a change token for a specific save operation.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`saveOperation`

A constant that indicates whether the save operation is writing a new file or overwriting an existing one. See `UIDocument.SaveOperation` for descriptions of these constants.

## Return Value

An object to use as a change-count token.

## Discussion

To get autosaving capabilities for your documents, you must implement change tracking. Typically you do this by using an `UndoManager` object (assigned to `undoManager` property) to register changes or by calling the `updateChangeCount(_:)` method every time the user makes a change; UIKit then automatically determines whether there are unsaved changes and returns the proper value from `hasUnsavedChanges`. If you take neither of these approaches (and you want the autosaving feature), you must implement this method as well as `updateChangeCount(withToken:for:)` and `hasUnsavedChanges`.

You implement this particular method to return a change-count token that UIKit uses to encapsulate the history of document changes for a particular save operation. The token can be any object that represents the current change state of the document. This method is called at the start of the default implementation of the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method. At the end of this default implementation, it calls the `updateChangeCount(withToken:for:)` method, passing in the change-count token. You implement the latter method to compare the token with the one returned earlier; by doing so, you can determine if the document has acquired new unsaved changes between the start and end of an asynchronous write operation. You can then return the proper value from your override of `hasUnsavedChanges`.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/autosave(completionhandler:)

- autosave(completionHandler:)

Instance Method

# autosave(completionHandler:)

Initiates automatic saving of documents with unsaved changes.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`completionHandler`

A block with code to execute after automatic saving concludes. The block returns no value and has one parameter:

`success`

`true` if the autosaving operation succeeds, otherwise `false`.

The block is invoked on the calling queue.

## Discussion

`UIDocument` periodically invokes this method to initiate a save operation if there are unsaved changes. You shouldn’t call this method directly. Subclasses can override it if they want to do special things with autosaving. The default implementation of this method invokes the `hasUnsavedChanges` method and, if that returns `true`, it invokes the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method.

This method should only be invoked for period-based saves. You may invoke it with the `success` parameter of the completion-handler parameter set to `false` and return; this makes it safe to not actually save when `autosave(completionHandler:)` is invoked. However, if you call `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`, saving of document data must occur.

Instance Property

# userActivity

An object encapsulating a user activity supported by this document.

@MainActor
var userActivity: NSUserActivity? { get set }

## Discussion

`UIDocument` automatically creates `NSUserActivity` objects. The system makes user activities eligible for Handoff if the document is iCloud-based and the app’s `Info.plist` property list file includes a `CFBundleDocumentTypes` key of `NSUbiquitousDocumentUserActivityType`. The value of `NSUbiquitousDocumentUserActivityType` is a string that represents the `NSUserActivity` object’s activity type. The document’s URL is in the `NSUserActivity` object’s `userInfo` dictionary with the `userActivityURLKey`.

In iOS, to make an `NSUserActivity` object that UIKit manages current, you must either call `becomeCurrent()` explicitly or have the document’s `NSUserActivity` object also set on a `UIViewController` object that’s in the view hierarchy when the app comes to the foreground.

You can use this property from any thread. It’s KVO-observable in case you share the `userActivity` object with other objects that need to be kept in sync as the document moves into and out of iCloud.

## Discussion

Subclasses override this method to restore the responder’s state with the given user activity. The override should use the state data contained in the `userInfo` dictionary of the given user activity to restore the object.

User activities managed by `NSDocument` can be restored automatically, if `false` is returned from `application:continueActivity:restorationHandler:` or if it’s unimplemented. In this situation, the document is opened by the `NSDocumentController` method `openDocument(withContentsOf:display:completionHandler:)` and receives a `restoreUserActivityState(_:)` message.

## Parameters

`error`

An error object encapsulating information about the error.

## Parameters

`error`

An error object encapsulating information about the error.

## Discussion

UIKit calls this method when it’s no longer safe to proceed without immediately handling the error, such as when the application is being suspended. Subclasses that override this method must immediately end error handling (including dismissing any interactive user interface) and call `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)` before returning. It’s only necessary to override this method if you override `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)` without invoking the superclass implementation ( `super`).

When the `NSUbiquitousDocumentUserActivityType` key is present in a `CFBundleDocumentTypes` entry, AppKit automatically creates an `NSUserActivity` object for documents in iCloud, using the given activity type.

# Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

Learn how to handle events that propagate through your app.

## Overview

Apps receive and handle events using _responder objects_. A responder object is any instance of the `UIResponder` class, and common subclasses include `UIView`, `UIViewController`, and `UIApplication`. Responders receive the raw event data and must either handle the event or forward it to another responder object. When your app receives an event, UIKit automatically directs that event to the most appropriate responder object, known as the _first responder_.

Unhandled events are passed from responder to responder in the active _responder chain_, which is the dynamic configuration of your app’s responder objects. The following image shows the responders in an app whose interface contains a label, a text field, a button, and two background views. The diagram also shows how events move from one responder to the next, following the responder chain.

If the text field doesn’t handle an event, UIKit sends the event to the text field’s parent `UIView` object, followed by the root view of the window. From the root view, the responder chain diverts to the owning view controller before directing the event to the window. If the window can’t handle the event, UIKit delivers the event to the `UIApplication` object, and possibly to the app delegate if that object is an instance of `UIResponder` and not already part of the responder chain.

### Determine an event’s first responder

UIKit designates an object as the first responder to an event based on the type of that event. Event types include:

| Event type | First responder |
| --- | --- |
| Touch events | The view in which the touch occurred. |
| Press events | The object that has focus. |
| Shake-motion events | The object that you (or UIKit) designate. |
| Remote-control events | The object that you (or UIKit) designate. |
| Editing menu messages | The object that you (or UIKit) designate. |

Controls communicate directly with their associated target object using action messages. When the user interacts with a control, the control sends an action message to its target object. Action messages aren’t events, but they may still take advantage of the responder chain. When the target object of a control is `nil`, UIKit starts from the target object and traverses the responder chain until it finds an object that implements the appropriate action method. For example, the UIKit editing menu uses this behavior to search for responder objects that implement methods with names like `cut(_:)`, `copy(_:)`, or `paste(_:)`.

Gesture recognizers receive touch and press events before their view does. If a view’s gesture recognizers fail to recognize a sequence of touches, UIKit sends the touches to the view. If the view doesn’t handle the touches, UIKit passes them up the responder chain. For more information about using gesture recognizer’s to handle events, see Handling UIKit gestures.

### Determine which responder contained a touch event

UIKit uses view-based hit-testing to determine where touch events occur. Specifically, UIKit compares the touch location to the bounds of view objects in the view hierarchy. The `hitTest(_:with:)` method of `UIView` traverses the view hierarchy, looking for the deepest subview that contains the specified touch, which becomes the first responder for the touch event.

When a touch occurs, UIKit creates a `UITouch` object and associates it with a view. As the touch location or other parameters change, UIKit updates the same `UITouch` object with the new information. The only property that doesn’t change is the view. (Even when the touch location moves outside the original view, the value in the touch’s `view` property doesn’t change). When the touch ends, UIKit releases the `UITouch` object.

### Alter the responder chain

You can alter the responder chain by overriding the `next` property of your responder objects. When you do this, the next responder is the object that you return.

Many UIKit classes already override this property and return specific objects, including:

- `UIView` objects. If the view is the root view of a view controller, the next responder is the view controller; otherwise, the next responder is the view’s superview.

- `UIViewController` objects.

- If the view controller’s view is the root view of a window, the next responder is the window object.

- If the view controller was presented by another view controller, the next responder is the presenting view controller.

- `UIWindow` objects. The window’s next responder is the `UIApplication` object.

- `UIApplication` object. The next responder is the app delegate, but only if the app delegate is an instance of `UIResponder` and isn’t a view, view controller, or the app object itself.

# About the app launch sequence

Learn the order in which the system executes your code at app launch time.

## Overview

An app launch involves a complex sequence of steps, most of which the system handles automatically. During the launch sequence, UIKit calls methods in your app delegate and scene delegate so you can prepare your app for user interaction and perform any tasks specific to your app’s requirements. The following illustrates the individual steps of this launch sequence, from when the user or system launches your app to when the sequence completes:

1. The system executes the `main()` function that Xcode provides in an Objective-C project, or that’s available when you use `@main` in a Swift project.

2. The `main()` function calls `UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)`, which creates an instance of `UIApplication` and your app delegate.

3. UIKit calls the `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method in your app delegate.

4. UIKit performs view controller state restoration, which results in the execution of additional methods in your app delegate and app’s view controllers. For more information, see About the UI restoration process.

5. UIKit calls your app delegate’s `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.

6. After the app launch completes, UIKit prepares a scene to connect to your app, and then calls `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)`. UIKit may deliver a user activity to this method for you to handle during scene connection.

After the launch sequence completes, the system displays your app’s user interface and informs your app or scene delegates when life-cycle events occur.

### Prepare your app for prewarming

In iOS 15 and later, the system may, depending on device conditions, _prewarm_ your app — launch nonrunning application processes to reduce the amount of time the user waits before the app is usable. Prewarming executes an app’s launch sequence up until, but not including, when `main()` calls `UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)`. This provides the system with an opportunity to build and cache any low-level structures it requires in anticipation of a full launch.

After the system prewarms your app, its launch sequence remains in a paused state until the app launches and the sequence resumes, or the system removes the prewarmed app from memory to reclaim resources. The system can prewarm your app after a device reboot, and periodically as system conditions allow.

If your app executes code before the call to `UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)`, such as in static initializers like `load()`, don’t make assumptions about what services and resources are available. For example, keychain items may be unavailable because their data protection policies require an unlocked device and prewarming happens even when the device is in a locked state. If your code is dependent upon access to a specific service or resource, migrate that code to a later part of the launch sequence.

Prewarming an app results in an indeterminate amount of time between when the prewarming phase completes and when the user, or system, fully launches the app. Because of this, use MetricKit to accurately measure user-driven launch and resume times instead of manually signposting various points of the launch sequence.

# About the UI preservation process

Learn how to customize the UIKit state preservation process.

## Overview

The following diagram shows the sequence of calls that happens during the interface preservation process. After asking your app delegate if you want your app state to be preserved, UIKit encodes the objects currently in your app’s view controller hierarchy. Only view controllers with a valid `restorationIdentifier` are preserved.

The preservation process walks your view controller hierarchy and recursively encodes the objects that it finds. The process starts with the root view controllers of your app’s windows, which write their data to the provided archive. If the root view controller’s data includes references to other view controllers, UIKit asks each new view controller to encode its data in a separate portion of the archive. Those child view controllers may then encode their own children, and so on.

UIKit view controllers automatically encode their child view controllers, as appropriate. If you define a custom container view controller, your view controller’s `encodeRestorableState(with:)` method must similarly write any child view controllers to the provided archive.

### Exclude view controllers from preservation

There are two ways to exclude a view controller (and its views) from the state restoration process:

- Set its `restorationIdentifier` property to `nil`.

- Provide a restoration class and return `nil` from the `viewController(withRestorationIdentifierPath:coder:)` method.

Excluding a view controller prevents that view controller from being saved in the archive. It also excludes all of the view controller’s children from being preserved.

### Encode any object in your app

State restoration isn’t limited to your app’s views and view controllers. Any object that adopts the `UIStateRestoring` protocol can also be included in the restoration archive. For example, you might adopt this protocol in an object that stores global configuration data for your app. To add an object like this to the archive:

1. Register the object while your app is running by calling the `registerObject(forStateRestoration:restorationIdentifier:)` method of `UIApplication`. For example, you might register a configuration object immediately after creating it.

2. In one of your `encodeRestorableState(with:)` methods, encode the object into the restoration archive. You can also encode it in your app delegate’s `application(_:willEncodeRestorableStateWith:)` method.

You can encode any data you want for your custom objects, as long as it’s sufficient to return that object to its previous state during the next launch cycle. Encode data that isn’t crucial to your app’s behavior, and never encode data that should be persisted in other ways. For example, don’t encode your app’s settings or user data that must persist between launch cycles.

## Mentioned in

Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

## Overview

Windows work with your view controllers to handle events and to perform many other tasks that are fundamental to your app’s operation. UIKit handles most window-related interactions, working with other objects as needed to implement many app behaviors.

You use windows only when you need to do the following:

- Provide a main window to display your app’s content.

- Create additional windows (as needed) to display additional content.

Normally, Xcode provides your app’s main window. New iOS projects use storyboards to define the app’s views. Storyboards require the presence of a `window` property on the app delegate object, which the Xcode templates automatically provide. If your app doesn’t use storyboards, you must create this window yourself.

Most apps need only one window, which displays the app’s content on the device’s main screen. Although you can create additional windows on the device’s main screen, extra windows are commonly used to display content on an external screen, as described in Presenting content on a connected display.

You also use `UIWindow` objects for a handful of other tasks:

- Setting the z-axis level of your window, which affects the visibility of the window relative to other windows.

- Showing windows and making them the target of keyboard events.

- Converting coordinate values to and from the window’s coordinate system.

- Changing the root view controller of a window.

- Changing the screen on which the window is displayed.

Windows don’t have any visual appearance of their own. Instead, a window hosts one or more views, which are managed by the window’s root view controller. You configure the root view controller in your storyboards, adding whatever views are appropriate for your interface.

You should rarely need to subclass `UIWindow`. The kinds of behaviors you might implement in a window can usually be implemented in a higher-level view controller more easily. One of the few times you might want to subclass is to override the `becomeKey()` or `resignKey()` methods to implement custom behaviors when a window’s key status changes. For information about how to display a window on a specific screen, see `UIScreen`.

### Understand keyboard interactions

Whereas touch events are delivered to the window where they occurred, events that don’t have a relevant coordinate value are delivered to the _key window_. Only one window at a time can be the key window, and you can use a window’s `isKeyWindow` property to determine its status. Most of the time, your app’s main window is the key window, but UIKit may designate a different window as needed.

If you need to know which window is key, observe the `didBecomeKeyNotification` and `didResignKeyNotification` notifications. The system sends those notifications on the main actor in response to key window changes in your app. To force a window become key, or to force a window to resign the key status, call the appropriate methods of this class.

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIApplication
- open(\_:options:completionHandler:)

Instance Method

# open(\_:options:completionHandler:)

Attempts to asynchronously open the resource at the specified URL.

@MainActor
func open(
_ url: URL,
options: [UIApplication.OpenExternalURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:],

)
@MainActor
func open(
_ url: URL,
options: [UIApplication.OpenExternalURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]

## Parameters

`url`

A URL (Universal Resource Locator). The resource identified by this URL may be local to the current app or it may be one that must be provided by a different app. UIKit supports many common schemes, including the `http`, `https`, `tel`, `facetime`, and `mailto` schemes. You can also employ custom URL schemes associated with apps installed on the device.

`options`

A dictionary of options to use when opening the URL. For a list of possible keys to include in this dictionary, see `UIApplication.OpenExternalURLOptionsKey`.

`completion`

The block to execute with the results. Provide a value for this parameter if you want to be informed of the success or failure of opening the URL. This block is executed asynchronously on your app’s main thread. The block has no return value and takes the following parameter:

success

A Boolean value that indicates whether the URL was opened successfully.

## Discussion

Use this method to open the specified resource. If the specified URL scheme is handled by another app, iOS launches that app and passes the URL to it. (Launching the app brings the other app to the foreground.) If no app is capable of handling the specified scheme, the completion handler is called with the _success_ parameter set to `false`.

To determine whether an app is installed that is capable of handling the URL, call the `canOpenURL(_:)` method before calling this one. Be sure to read the description of that method for an important note about registering the schemes you want to employ.

Instance Method

# registerForRemoteNotifications()

Registers to receive remote notifications through Apple Push Notification service.

tvOS

@MainActor
func registerForRemoteNotifications()

## Discussion

Call this method to initiate the registration process with Apple Push Notification service. If registration succeeds, the app calls your app delegate object’s `application(_:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:)` method and passes it a device token. You should pass this token along to the server you use to generate remote notifications for the device. If registration fails, the app calls its app delegate’s `application(_:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:)` method instead.

If you want your app’s remote notifications to display alerts, play sounds, or perform other user-facing actions, you must request authorization to do so using the `requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:)` method of `UNUserNotificationCenter`. If you do not request and receive authorization for your app’s interactions, the system delivers all remote notifications to your app silently.

- UIKit

- canOpenURL(\_:)

Instance Method

# canOpenURL(\_:)

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether an app is available to handle a URL scheme.

tvOS

nonisolated

## Parameters

`url`

A URL (Universal Resource Locator). At runtime, the system determines if the device has an installed app registered to handle the URL’s scheme. The device can have more than one app registered to handle a scheme.

The URL can have a common scheme such as `http`, `https`, `tel`, or `facetime`, or a custom scheme. For information about supported schemes, see Apple URL Scheme Reference.

## Return Value

`false` if the device doesn’t have an installed app registered to handle the URL’s scheme, or if you haven’t declared the URL’s scheme in your `Info.plist` file; otherwise, `true`.

## Discussion

When this method returns `true`, iOS guarantees subsequent calls to the `open(_:options:completionHandler:)` method with the same URL will successfully launch an app that can handle the URL. The return value doesn’t indicate the validity of the URL, whether the specified resource exists, or, in the case of a universal link, whether the device has an installed app registered to respond to the universal link.

You can call this method safely on a thread that isn’t the main thread.

If you link your app against an earlier version of iOS but it is running in iOS 9.0 or later, you can call this method up to 50 times. After reaching that limit, subsequent calls always return `false`. If the user reinstalls or upgrades the app, iOS resets the limit.

Unlike this method, the `open(_:options:completionHandler:)` method isn’t constrained by the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` requirement. If an app is available to handle the URL, the system will launch it, even if you haven’t declared the scheme.

Using universal links instead of custom URL schemes removes the need to use this method to validate target links; if no app is available to handle a universal link, iOS routes it to the person’s default browser, allowing the associated website to respond. For more information on universal links, see Allowing apps and websites to link to your content.

- beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)

Instance Method

# beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)

Marks the start of a task that should continue if the app enters the background.

tvOS

**tvOS, visionOS**

nonisolated

**iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst**

## Parameters

`handler`

A handler to be called shortly before the app’s remaining background time reaches 0. Use this handler to clean up and mark the end of the background task. Failure to end the task explicitly will result in the termination of the app. The system calls the handler synchronously on the main thread, blocking the app’s suspension momentarily.

## Return Value

A unique identifier for the new background task. You must pass this value to the `endBackgroundTask(_:)` method to mark the end of this task. This method returns `invalid` if running in the background isn’t possible.

## Discussion

This method requests additional background execution time for your app. Call this method when leaving a task unfinished might be detrimental to your app’s user experience. For example, call this method before writing data to a file to prevent the system from suspending your app while the operation is in progress. For background tasks requiring more time, use Background Tasks.

Call this method as early as possible before starting your task, preferably before your app actually enters the background. The method requests the task assertion for your app asynchronously. If you call this method shortly before your app is due to be suspended, there’s a chance that the system might suspend your app before that task assertion is granted. For example, don’t call this method at the very end of your `applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)` method and expect your app to continue running. If the system is unable to grant the task assertion, it calls your expiration handler.

Each call to this method must be balanced by a matching call to the `endBackgroundTask(_:)` method. Apps running background tasks have a finite amount of time in which to run them. (You can find out the maximum background time available using the `backgroundTimeRemaining` property.) If you don’t call `endBackgroundTask(_:)` for each task before time expires, the system kills the app. If you provide a block object in the `handler` parameter, the system calls your handler before time expires to give you a chance to end the task.

You can call this method at any point in your app’s execution. You may also call this method multiple times to mark the beginning of several background tasks that run in parallel. However, each task must be ended separately. You identify a given task using the value returned by this method.

To assist with debugging, this method generates a name for the task, based on the name of the calling method or function. If you want to specify a custom name, use the `beginBackgroundTask(withName:expirationHandler:)` method instead.

This method can be safely called on a non-main thread. To extend the execution time of an app extension, use the `performExpiringActivity(withReason:using:)` method of `ProcessInfo` instead.

Sends an action message identified by the selector to a specified target.

tvOS

@MainActor
func sendAction(
_ action: Selector,
to target: Any?,
from sender: Any?,
for event: UIEvent?

## Parameters

`action`

A selector identifying an action method. See the discussion for information on the permitted selector forms.

`target`

The object to receive the action message. If `target` is `nil`, the app sends the message to the first responder, from whence it progresses up the responder chain until it is handled.

`sender`

The object that is sending the action message. The default sender is the `UIControl` object that invokes this method.

`event`

A `UIEvent` object that encapsulates information about the event originating the action message.

## Return Value

`true` if a responder object handled the action message, `false` if no object in the responder chain handled the message.

## Discussion

Normally, this method is invoked by a `UIControl` object that the user has touched. The default implementation dispatches the action method to the given target object or, if no target is specified, to the first responder. Subclasses may override this method to perform special dispatching of action messages.

By default, this method pushes two parameters when calling the target. These last two parameters are optional for the receiver because it is up to the caller (usually a `UIControl` object) to remove any parameters it added. This design enables the action selector to be one of the following:

- `- (void)action`

- `- (void)action:(id)sender`

- `- (void)action:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent *)event`

# delegate

The delegate of the app object.

@MainActor
unowned(unsafe) var delegate: (any UIApplicationDelegate)? { get set }

## Discussion

Every app must have an app delegate object to respond to app-related messages. For example, the app notifies its delegate when the app finishes launching and when its foreground or background execution status changes. Similarly, app-related messages coming from the system are often routed to the app delegate for handling. Xcode provides an initial app delegate for every app and you should not need to change this delegate later.

The delegate must adopt the `UIApplicationDelegate` formal protocol.

Instance Property

# applicationState

The app’s current state, or that of its most active scene.

tvOS

@MainActor
var applicationState: UIApplication.State { get }

## Discussion

The behavior of this property depends on whether your app is scene-based.

In a scene-based app, this property takes the value of the most active scene, which it determines from each scene’s `activationState` property. A scene-based app launches in the background state, and transitions between its states as scenes connect, change their states, and disconnect. For scene-based apps, use `UISceneDelegate` to respond to changes in an individual scene’s life cycle.

In a sceneless app, the property’s value is always the app’s current state. The app is inactive at launch, and then is generally in either an active or background state. The app may become inactive for a short period — for example, when transitioning between active and background states, when the system presents an alert in front of it, or when the system displays the application switcher. For sceneless apps, use `UIApplicationDelegate` to respond to the app’s life cycle changes.

Information for the system to use when dismissing the scene. For information about how to create this object, see `UISceneDestructionRequestOptions`.

`errorHandler`

An error handler block to execute if a problem occurs. The method does not execute this block when it successfully dismisses the scene. This block has no return value and has the following parameter:

error

The `NSError` object describing the problem that occurred.

## Discussion

If the specified scene is onscreen, calling this method dismisses it using the specified options. The method sends a disconnect notification to the scene and then calls your app delegate’s `application(_:didDiscardSceneSessions:)` method.

struct UISceneSessionActivationRequest

## Overview

A `UISceneSessionActiviationRequest` object provides information about how to activate a scene session. Create a request to specify:

- A user activity for the scene session.

- An existing scene session.

- A scene session with a specific role.

You create a `UISceneSessionActivationRequest` object in your code, then you pass it as a parameter when you call `activateSceneSession(for:errorHandler:)` to ask the system to activate the scene session.

## Topics

### Creating a request

`init(role: UISceneSession.Role, userActivity: NSUserActivity?, options: UIScene.ActivationRequestOptions?)`

Creates a scene session activation request object with a role, a user activity, and options that you provide.

`init(session: UISceneSession, userActivity: NSUserActivity?, options: UIScene.ActivationRequestOptions?)`

Creates a scene session activation request object with a scene session, a user activity, and options that you provide.

### Managing request details

`var options: UIScene.ActivationRequestOptions?`

Activation request options to further customize the request.

`var role: UISceneSession.Role`

The role to request.

`var session: UISceneSession?`

The specific scene session to activate.

`var userActivity: NSUserActivity?`

A user activity to send to the newly activated scene.

### Initializers

Create a `UIScene.ActivationRequestOptions` object before you activate or create a scene using the `activateSceneSession(for:errorHandler:)` (Swift) or `activateSceneSessionForRequest:errorHandler:` (Objective-C) method of `UIApplication`. Use this object to specify which of your app’s existing scenes originated the request for the new scene.

## Topics

### Specifying the originator of the request

`var requestingScene: UIScene?`

The scene object that requested the activation of a different scene.

### Specifying collection join behavior

`var collectionJoinBehavior: UISceneCollectionJoinBehavior`

The behavior that specifies how a new scene joins a scene collection.

- backgroundRefreshStatus

Instance Property

# backgroundRefreshStatus

Indicates whether the app can refresh content when running in the background.

@MainActor
var backgroundRefreshStatus: UIBackgroundRefreshStatus { get }

## Discussion

You can use this property to determine whether Background App Refresh—an app’s ability to open in the background to perform refresh tasks—is enabled, and warn the user if it is not. Don’t warn the user if the value of this property is set to `UIBackgroundRefreshStatus.restricted`. A restricted user, such as one who is managed under parental controls, can’t enable Background App Refresh.

Background App Refresh is disabled automatically when a device is operating in low-power mode. When this happens, the time available for performing background tasks is reduced to save power.

## Discussion

UIKit restores your app’s state synchronously on the main thread. If you choose to perform additional state restoration on a secondary thread, call this method to inform UIKit of that fact. You must balance each call to this method with a matching call to the `completeStateRestoration()` method.

Calling this method is a safety precaution in the event that your app crashes at launch time due to problems restoring its state. If you call this method but do not call the matching `completeStateRestoration()` method before a crash occurs, the system throws away any saved state information. Doing so prevents your app from crashing during subsequent launches because of issues caused by trying to restore your app’s state.

## Discussion

As part of the state preservation process, UIKit captures your app’s user interface and stores it in an image file. When your app is relaunched, the system displays this snapshot image in place of your app’s default launch image to preserve the notion that your app was still running. If you feel that the snapshot cannot correctly reflect your app’s user interface when your app is relaunched, call this method to let UIKit know that it should use your app’s default launch image instead of the snapshot.

You must call this method from within the code you use to preserve your app’s state.

## Mentioned in

About the UI preservation process

## Discussion

You use this method to register objects that you want to save as part of the overall state restoration process. Registering the object makes it available for inclusion in the restoration archive but does not automatically include it. To include the object, refer to it from one of your other interface objects. For example, you might write out a reference to the object from the `encodeRestorableState(with:)` method of one of your view controllers.

Instance Property

# supportsAlternateIcons

A Boolean value that indicates whether the app is allowed to change its icon.

@MainActor
var supportsAlternateIcons: Bool { get }

## Discussion

The value of this property is `true` only when the system allows you to change the icon of your app. To declare your app’s alternate icons, include them in the `CFBundleIcons` key of your app’s `Info.plist` file.

The value of this property is always `false` for apps built using the visionOS SDK.

## Discussion

When the system is displaying one of your app’s alternate icons, the value of this property is the name of the alternate icon (from your app’s `Info.plist` file). When the system is displaying your app’s primary icon, the value of this property is `nil`.

Changes the icon the system displays for the app.

@MainActor
func setAlternateIconName(
_ alternateIconName: String?,

)
@MainActor
func setAlternateIconName(_ alternateIconName: String?) async throws

## Parameters

`alternateIconName`

The name of the alternate icon, as declared in the `CFBundleAlternateIcons` key of your app’s `Info.plist` file. Specify `nil` if you want to display the app’s primary icon, which you declare using the `CFBundlePrimaryIcon` key. Both keys are subentries of the `CFBundleIcons` key in your app’s `Info.plist` file.

`completionHandler`

The handler to execute with the results. After attempting to change your app’s icon, the system reports the results by calling your handler. The handler executes on a UIKit-provided queue, and not necessarily on your app’s main queue. The handler has no return value and takes the following parameter:

error

On success, the value of this parameter is `nil`. If an error occurred, this parameter contains the error object indicating what happened and the value of the `alternateIconName` property remains unchanged.

## Discussion

Use this method to change your app’s icon to its primary icon or to one of its alternate icons. You can change the icon only if the value of the `supportsAlternateIcons` property is `true`.

You must configure your app’s primary icon asset in the “App Icons and Launch Images” section of the General pane or set it directly using the “Primary App Icon Set Name” build setting. You specify the names of additional icon assets available to your app using the “Alternate App Icon Sets” build setting. Xcode uses these setting to generate the entries for `CFBundlePrimaryIcon` and `CFBundleAlternateIcons` under the top-level key `CFBundleIcons`. For more information, see Build settings reference and Configuring your app icon using an asset catalog.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/preferredcontentsizecategory

- UIKit
- UIApplication
- preferredContentSizeCategory

Instance Property

# preferredContentSizeCategory

The font sizing option preferred by the user.

tvOS

@MainActor
var preferredContentSizeCategory: UIContentSizeCategory { get }

## Discussion

Users can request that apps display fonts in a size that is larger or smaller than the normal font size defined by the system. For example, a user with a visual impairment might request a larger default font size to make it easier to read text. Font objects returned by the system automatically scale based on the user’s preference. You can use the value of this property to request a font object of the appropriate size.

When the value of this property changes, the app object sends a `didChangeNotification` notification so that observers can respond accordingly.

For a list of possible values, see `Content Size Category Constants` and `Accessibility Content Size Category Constants`.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/supportedinterfaceorientations(for:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIApplication
- supportedInterfaceOrientations(for:)

Instance Method

# supportedInterfaceOrientations(for:)

Returns the default set of interface orientations to use for the view controllers in the specified window.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`window`

The window whose default interface orientations you want to retrieve.

## Return Value

A bit mask specifying which orientations are supported. See `UIInterfaceOrientationMask` for valid bit-mask values. The value returned by this method must not be `0`.

## Discussion

Starting in iOS 8, you should employ the `UITraitCollection` and `UITraitEnvironment` APIs, and size class properties as used in those APIs, instead of using this method or otherwise writing your app in terms of interface orientation.

This method returns the default interface orientations for the app. These orientations are used only for view controllers that do not specify their own. If your app delegate implements the `application(_:supportedInterfaceOrientationsFor:)` method, the system does not call this method.

The default implementation of this method returns the app’s default set of supported interface orientations, as you define them in the UISupportedInterfaceOrientations key of the `Info.plist` file in your Xcode project. If the file does not contain that key, this method returns all interface orientations for the iPad idiom and returns all interface orientations except the portrait upside-down orientation for the iPhone idiom.

- isDefault(\_:)

Instance Method

# isDefault(\_:)

Reports whether this app is the person’s default app in the given category.

nonisolated

## Parameters

`category`

The type of app for which you test whether your app is the default.

## Return Value

If the system determines the status of the app, this method returns `true` if the app is the default app in the category, and `false` otherwise. If the system doesn’t determine the status, or the app exceeds the threshold rate for calling this method, it throws an error.

## Discussion

To reduce the likelihood that users face continuous requests to set a browser as their default, this API only tells the browser app if it’s the default up to four times in a year. If you call the method too frequently, it throws an error with the domain `UIApplicationCategoryDefaultErrorDomain` and the code `rateLimited`. The error’s user information dictionary contains these keys:

`statusLastProvidedDateErrorKey`

The date at which the app most recently received a `true` or `false` response from this method.

`retryAvailableDateErrorKey`

The date at which the app can next request an updated response.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder

- UIKit
- UIResponder

Class

# UIResponder

An abstract interface for responding to and handling events.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIResponder

## Mentioned in

Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

Handling key presses made on a physical keyboard

## Overview

Responder objects — instances of `UIResponder` — constitute the event-handling backbone of a UIKit app. Many key objects are also responders, including the `UIApplication` object, `UIViewController` objects, and all `UIView` objects (which includes `UIWindow`). As events occur, UIKit dispatches them to your app’s responder objects for handling.

There are several kinds of events, including touch events, motion events, remote-control events, and press events. To handle a specific type of event, a responder must override the corresponding methods. For example, to handle touch events, a responder implements the `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, `touchesMoved(_:with:)`, `touchesEnded(_:with:)`, and `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` methods. In the case of touches, the responder uses the event information provided by UIKit to track changes to those touches and to update the app’s interface appropriately.

In addition to handling events, UIKit responders also manage the forwarding of unhandled events to other parts of your app. If a given responder doesn’t handle an event, it forwards that event to the next event in the responder chain. UIKit manages the responder chain dynamically, using predefined rules to determine which object should be next to receive an event. For example, a view forwards events to its superview, and the root view of a hierarchy forwards events to its view controller.

Responders process `UIEvent` objects but can also accept custom input through an input view. The system’s keyboard is the most obvious example of an input view. When the user taps a `UITextField` and `UITextView` object onscreen, the view becomes the first responder and displays its input view, which is the system keyboard. Similarly, you can create custom input views and display them when other responders become active. To associate a custom input view with a responder, assign that view to the `inputView` property of the responder.

For information about responders and the responder chain, see Using responders and the responder chain to handle events.

## Topics

### Managing the responder chain

`var next: UIResponder?`

Returns the next responder in the responder chain, or `nil` if there’s no next responder.

`var isFirstResponder: Bool`

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this object is the first responder.

`var canBecomeFirstResponder: Bool`

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this object can become the first responder.

Asks UIKit to make this object the first responder in its window.

`var canResignFirstResponder: Bool`

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the responder is willing to relinquish first-responder status.

Notifies this object that it has been asked to relinquish its status as first responder in its window.

### Responding to touch events

Tells this object that one or more new touches occurred in a view or window.

Tells the responder when one or more touches associated with an event changed.

Tells the responder when one or more fingers are raised from a view or window.

Tells the responder when a system event (such as a system alert) cancels a touch sequence.

Tells the responder that updated values were received for previously estimated properties or that an update is no longer expected.

### Responding to motion events

`func motionBegan(UIEvent.EventSubtype, with: UIEvent?)`

### Responding to press events

Generally, responders that handle press events should override all four of these methods.

Tells this object when a physical button is first pressed.

Tells this object when a value associated with a press has changed.

Tells the object when a button is released.

Tells this object when a system event (such as a low-memory warning) cancels a press event.

Asks the receiving responder to create and configure a Touch Bar object.

`var touchBar: NSTouchBar?`

The Touch Bar object for the responder.

### Constants

`class let keyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey: String`

A user info key to retrieve the animation curve that the system uses to animate the keyboard onto or off the screen.

`class let keyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey: String`

A user info key to retrieve the duration of the keyboard animation in seconds.

A notification that posts immediately after a change in the keyboard’s frame.

`class let keyboardDidHideNotification: NSNotification.Name`

A notification that posts immediately after dismissing the keyboard.

`class let keyboardDidShowNotification: NSNotification.Name`

A notification that posts immediately after displaying the keyboard.

`class let keyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey: String`

A user info key to retrieve the keyboard’s frame at the beginning of its animation.

`class let keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey: String`

A user info key to retrieve the keyboard’s frame at the end of its animation.

`class let keyboardIsLocalUserInfoKey: String`

A user info key to retrieve a Boolean value that indicates whether the keyboard belongs to the current app.

Protocol

# UIActivityItemsConfigurationProviding

An interface that provides a source for shareable content to fulfill user requests to share current content.

protocol UIActivityItemsConfigurationProviding : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

The user can share content from your app in a number of ways:

- Ask Siri to “share this” on an iOS device.

- Click an `NSSharingServicePickerToolbarItem` in the toolbar of an app built with Mac Catalyst.

- Start a `UIContextMenuInteraction` by using Force Touch or a long press gesture.

When one of these interactions happens, the system asks your view controller for content to share. Supply multiple representations of the current content, such as a file, image, and URL.

# Implementing a Multi-Touch app

Learn how to create a simple app that handles multitouch input.

## Overview

Consider the app shown in the following image, where a single main view that draws a gray circle at each touch location. When a touch ends, the circle disappears. When the user’s fingers move, the underlying circles move with them.

The creation of this app begins with the Single View app template in Xcode. This type of app has a single view controller whose view — in this case, a custom subclass of `UIView` called `TouchableView` — fills the screen. The view contains only a label initially, but the app programmatically adds subviews later. The following image shows the storyboard for the view controller.

### Implement the TouchableView class

The `TouchableView` class overrides the inherited `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, `touchesMoved(_:with:)`, `touchesEnded(_:with:)`, and `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` methods. These methods handle the creation and management of subviews that draw the gray circles at each touch location. Specifically, these methods do the following:

- The `touchesBegan(_:with:)` method creates a new subview at the location of each touch event.

- The `touchesMoved(_:with:)` method updates the position of the subview associated with each touch.

- The `touchesEnded(_:with:)` and `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` methods remove the subview associated with each touch that ended.

The following code shows the main implementation of the `TouchableView` class and its touch handling methods. Each method iterates through the touches and performs the needed actions. The `touchViews` dictionary uses the `UITouch` objects as keys to retrieve the subviews the user is manipulating onscreen.

class TouchableView: UIView {
var touchViews = UITouch:TouchSpotView

override init(frame: CGRect) {
super.init(frame: frame)
isMultipleTouchEnabled = true
}

required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
super.init(coder: aDecoder)
isMultipleTouchEnabled = true
}

for touch in touches {
createViewForTouch(touch: touch)
}
}

for touch in touches {
let view = viewForTouch(touch: touch)
// Move the view to the new location.
let newLocation = touch.location(in: self)
view?.center = newLocation
}
}

for touch in touches {
removeViewForTouch(touch: touch)
}
}

// Other methods. . .
}

Several helper methods handle creation, management, and disposal of the subviews, as shown in the following code. The `createViewForTouch` method creates a new `TouchSpotView` object and adds it to the `TouchableView` object, animating the view to its full size. The `removeViewForTouch` method removes the corresponding subview and updates the class data structures. The `viewForTouch` method is a convenience method for retrieving the view associated with a given touch event.

func createViewForTouch( touch : UITouch ) {
let newView = TouchSpotView()
newView.bounds = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 1, height: 1)
newView.center = touch.location(in: self)

// Add the view and animate it to a new size.
addSubview(newView)
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.2) {
newView.bounds.size = CGSize(width: 100, height: 100)
}

// Save the views internally
touchViews[touch] = newView
}

return touchViews[touch]
}

func removeViewForTouch (touch : UITouch ) {
if let view = touchViews[touch] {
view.removeFromSuperview()
touchViews.removeValue(forKey: touch)
}
}

### Implement the TouchSpotView class

The `TouchSpotView` class (shown in the following code) represents the custom subviews that draw the gray circles onscreen. `TouchSpotView` maintains its circular shape by setting the `cornerRadius` property of the layer each time its `bounds` property changes.

class TouchSpotView : UIView {
override init(frame: CGRect) {
super.init(frame: frame)
backgroundColor = UIColor.lightGray
}

// Update the corner radius when the bounds change.
override var bounds: CGRect {
get { return super.bounds }
set(newBounds) {
super.bounds = newBounds
layer.cornerRadius = newBounds.size.width / 2.0
}
}
}

# Making a view into a drag source

Adopt drag interaction APIs to provide items for dragging.

## Overview

By implementing a drag interaction delegate ( `UIDragInteractionDelegate`) for a view, you enable that view to function as a drag source in your app.

### Enable a view as a drag source

Any instance or subclass of `UIView` can act as a drag source. Your first steps to make this happen are:

1. Create a drag interaction (a `UIDragInteraction` instance).

2. Specify the drag interaction’s delegate (an object that conforms to the `UIDragInteractionDelegate` protocol).

3. Add the interaction to the view’s `interactions` property.

Here’s how to do this using a custom helper method, which you’d typically call within a view controller’s `viewDidLoad()` method:

func customEnableDragging(on view: UIView, dragInteractionDelegate: UIDragInteractionDelegate) {
let dragInteraction = UIDragInteraction(delegate: dragInteractionDelegate)
view.addInteraction(dragInteraction)
}

### Create a drag item

A drag item encapsulates a source app’s promises for providing a variety of data representations for one model object.

To create a drag item, implement the `dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)` method in your drag interaction delegate, as shown here in a minimal form:

// Cast to NSString is required for NSItemProviderWriting support.
let stringItemProvider = NSItemProvider(object: "Hello World" as NSString)
return [\
UIDragItem(itemProvider: stringItemProvider)\
]
}

This implementation uses the `init(object:)` convenience initializer. When you instantiate a drag item, pass an object in your app’s native representation, or in the highest-fidelity representation you support. In general, ensure that the first element in the item provider’s `registeredTypeIdentifiers` array represents the highest-fidelity data your drag interaction delegate can deliver.

To add more data representations to a drag item, as you typically would in your app, add them in fidelity order, from highest to lowest. When adding representations, you have choices:

- The best option for adding multiple data representations to a drag item, in many cases, is to adopt the `NSItemProviderWriting` protocol in your model class. Using this protocol, you place the code for providing multiple data representations within the model class.

- You can use the `registerObject(_:visibility:)` method, or related methods, from the `NSItemProvider` class, to explicitly register data representations.

### Understand a drag source in context

In the `dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)` protocol method, your source app responds to a request from the system. This request is itself triggered by the user starting to drag an item in your app’s UI. The conversation between your app and the system proceeds as shown here:

The figure above depicts the steps for constructing a drag item, in context:

1. The user initiates a drag activity with a long press on a view in your app, followed by moving their finger while still touching the screen. The system instantiates a drag session (an object that conforms to the `UIDragSession` protocol, not shown in the figure) for managing the drag activity.

2. The system calls the drag interaction delegate’s `dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)` protocol method. Your delegate returns one or more drag items.

3. Finally, the system populates the drag session with your drag items, ready for the user to move the drag session to a destination.

## Discussion

Setting this value to `true` causes subviews to be clipped to the bounds of the view. If set to `false`, subviews whose frames extend beyond the visible bounds of the view aren’t clipped.

The default value is `false`. Some subclasses of `UIView`, like `UIScrollView`, override the default value to `true`.

Instance Property

# frame

The frame rectangle, which describes the view’s location and size in its superview’s coordinate system.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
var frame: CGRect { get set }

## Discussion

This rectangle defines the size and position of the view in its superview’s coordinate system. Use this rectangle during layout operations to set the size and position the view. Setting this property changes the point specified by the `center` property and changes the size in the `bounds` rectangle accordingly. The coordinates of the frame rectangle are always specified in points.

Changing the frame rectangle automatically redisplays the view without calling its `draw(_:)` method. If you want UIKit to call the `draw(_:)` method when the frame rectangle changes, set the `contentMode` property to `UIView.ContentMode.redraw`.

Changes to this property can be animated. However, if the `transform` property contains a non-identity transform, the value of the `frame` property is undefined and should not be modified. In that case, reposition the view using the `center` property and adjust the size using the `bounds` property instead.

## Mentioned in

## Discussion

The default bounds origin is (0,0) and the size is the same as the size of the rectangle in the `frame` property. Changing the size portion of this rectangle grows or shrinks the view relative to its center point. Changing the size also changes the size of the rectangle in the `frame` property to match. The coordinates of the bounds rectangle are always specified in points.

Changing the bounds rectangle automatically redisplays the view without calling its `draw(_:)` method. If you want UIKit to call the `draw(_:)` method, set the `contentMode` property to `UIView.ContentMode.redraw`.

- draw(\_:)

Instance Method

# draw(\_:)

Draws the view’s image within the passed-in rectangle.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
func draw(_ rect: CGRect)

## Parameters

`rect`

The portion of the view’s bounds that needs to be updated. The first time your view is drawn, this rectangle is typically the entire visible bounds of your view. However, during subsequent drawing operations, the rectangle may specify only part of your view.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method does nothing. Subclasses that use technologies such as Core Graphics and UIKit to draw their view’s content should override this method and implement their drawing code there. You don’t need to override this method if your view sets its content in other ways. For example, you don’t need to override this method if your view just displays a background color or if your view sets its content directly using the underlying layer object.

By the time this method is called, UIKit has configured the drawing environment appropriately for your view and you can simply call whatever drawing methods and functions you need to render your content. Specifically, UIKit creates and configures a graphics context for drawing and adjusts the transform of that context so that its origin matches the origin of your view’s bounds rectangle. You can get a reference to the graphics context using the `UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()` function, but don’t establish a strong reference to the graphics context because it can change between calls to the `draw(_:)` method.

Similarly, if you draw using OpenGL ES and the `GLKView` class, GLKit configures the underlying OpenGL ES context appropriately for your view before calling this method (or the `glkView(_:drawIn:)` method of your `GLKView` delegate), so you can simply issue whatever OpenGL ES commands you need to render your content. For more information about how to draw using OpenGL ES, see OpenGL ES Programming Guide.

You should limit any drawing to the rectangle specified in the `rect` parameter. In addition, if the `isOpaque` property of your view is set to `true`, your `draw(_:)` method must totally fill the specified rectangle with opaque content.

If you subclass `UIView` directly, your implementation of this method doesn’t need to call `super`. However, if you’re subclassing a different view class, you should call `super` at some point in your implementation.

This method is called when a view is first displayed or when an event occurs that invalidates a visible part of the view. You should never call this method directly yourself. To invalidate part of your view, and thus cause that portion to be redrawn, call the `setNeedsDisplay()` or `setNeedsDisplay(_:)` method instead.

In iOS 18 and later, UIKit supports automatic trait tracking inside this method for traits from this view’s `traitCollection`. For more information, see Automatic trait tracking.

## Discussion

You can use this method or the `setNeedsDisplay(_:)` to notify the system that your view’s contents need to be redrawn. This method makes a note of the request and returns immediately. The view is not actually redrawn until the next drawing cycle, at which point all invalidated views are updated.

You should use this method to request that a view be redrawn only when the content or appearance of the view change. If you simply change the geometry of the view, the view is typically not redrawn. Instead, its existing content is adjusted based on the value in the view’s `contentMode` property. Redisplaying the existing content improves performance by avoiding the need to redraw content that has not changed.

The value of this property is a floating-point number in the range `0.0` to `1.0`, where `0.0` represents totally transparent and `1.0` represents totally opaque. Changing the value of this property updates the alpha value of the current view only. However, the transparency imparted by that alpha value affects all of the view’s contents, including its subviews.

Class

# UIViewPropertyAnimator

A class that animates changes to views and allows the dynamic modification of those animations.

@MainActor
class UIViewPropertyAnimator

## Overview

A `UIViewPropertyAnimator` object lets you animate changes to views and dynamically modify your animations before they finish. With a property animator, you can run your animations from start to finish normally or you can turn them into interactive animations and control the timing yourself. The animator operates on animatable properties of views, such as the `frame`, `center`, `alpha`, and `transform` properties, creating the needed animations from the blocks you provide.

When creating a property animator object, you specify the following:

- A block containing code that modifies the properties of one or more views.

- The timing curve that defines the speed of the animation over the course of its run.

- The duration (in seconds) of the animation.

- An optional completion block to execute when the animations finish.

In your animation blocks, set the value of an animatable property to the final value you want reflected by that view. For example, if you want to fade out a view, you would set its alpha property to `0` in your block. The property animator object creates an animation that adjusts the value of that property from its initial value to the new value that you specified in your block.

The speed at which the value of a property changes is controlled by the timing curve you specify when creating the property animator. Property animators include support for the built-in UIKit animation curves such as linear, ease-in, and ease-out. You can also use a cubic Bezier curve or a spring function to control the timing of the animations.

If you create your animator using one of the standard initialization methods, you must explicitly start your animations by calling the `startAnimation()` method. If you want to start the animations immediately after the creation of your animator, use the `runningPropertyAnimator(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)` method instead of the standard initializers.

This class adopts the `UIViewAnimating` and `UIViewImplicitlyAnimating` protocols, which define the methods for starting, stopping, and modifying your animations. For more information about the methods of those protocols, see `UIViewAnimating` and `UIViewImplicitlyAnimating`.

### Modify animations dynamically

A property animator gives you programmatic control over the timing and execution of the animations. Specifically, you can:

- Start, pause, resume, and stop animations; see the methods of the `UIViewAnimating` protocol.

- Add animation blocks after the original animations start using the `addAnimations(_:)` and `addAnimations(_:delayFactor:)` methods.

- Scrub through a paused animation by modifying the `fractionComplete` property.

- Change the animation’s direction using the `isReversed` property.

- Modify the timing and duration of a partially complete animation by pausing the animation and using the `continueAnimation(withTimingParameters:durationFactor:)` method to finish it.

Most of the basic behavior is controlled by the properties of the `UIViewAnimating` protocol, which this class adopts. Use those methods and properties to start, pause, resume, and stop the animations. You can also use them to scrub through the animation and change its direction. Use the methods and properties of this class to modify the animation blocks themselves and to update the timing information.

Adds the specified animation block with a delay.

Adds the specified completion block to the animator.

`func continueAnimation(withTimingParameters: (any UITimingCurveProvider)?, durationFactor: CGFloat)`

Adjusts the timing and duration of a paused animation.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/init(frame:)

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIView
- init(frame:)

Initializer

# init(frame:)

Creates a view with the specified frame rectangle.

tvOS

@MainActor
init(frame: CGRect)

## Parameters

`frame`

The frame rectangle for the view, measured in points. The origin of the frame is relative to the superview in which you plan to add it. This method uses the frame rectangle to set the `center` and `bounds` properties accordingly.

## Return Value

An initialized view object.

## Discussion

The new view object must be inserted into the view hierarchy of a window before it can be used. If you create a view object programmatically, this method is the designated initializer for the `UIView` class. Subclasses can override this method to perform any custom initialization but must call `super` at the beginning of their implementation.

If you use Interface Builder to design your interface, this method is not called when your view objects are subsequently loaded from the nib file. Objects in a nib file are reconstituted and then initialized using their doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/oslog/oslogentry/init(coder:) method, which modifies the attributes of the view to match the attributes stored in the nib file. For detailed information about how views are loaded from a nib file, see Resource Programming Guide.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/layerclass

- UIKit

Type Property

# layerClass

Returns the class used to create the layer for instances of this class.

tvOS

@MainActor
class var layerClass: AnyClass { get }

## Return Value

The class used to create the view’s Core Animation layer.

## Discussion

This method returns the `CALayer` class object by default. Subclasses can override this method and return a different layer class as needed. For example, if your view uses tiling to display a large scrollable area, you might want to override this property and return the `CATiledLayer` class, as shown in the following code.

override class var layerClass : AnyClass {
return CATiledLayer.self
}

This method is called only once early in the creation of the view in order to create the corresponding layer object.

Instance Method

# draw(\_:for:)

)

## Parameters

`rect`

A rectangle that defines the area for drawing printable content.

`formatter`

An instance of `UIViewPrintFormatter` obtained by calling the `viewPrintFormatter()` method.

## Discussion

You implement this method if you want a view’s printed content to appear differently than its displayed content. If you add a view print formatter to a print job but do not implement this method, the view’s `draw(_:)` method is called to provide the content for printing.

## Return Value

`true` if the view must be in a window using constraint-based layout to function properly, `false` otherwise.

#app-main)

- UIKit
- UIView
- updateConstraints()

Instance Method

# updateConstraints()

Updates constraints for the view.

tvOS

@MainActor
func updateConstraints()

## Discussion

Override this method to optimize changes to your constraints.

To schedule a change, call `setNeedsUpdateConstraints()` on the view. The system then calls your implementation of `updateConstraints()` before the layout occurs. This lets you verify that all necessary constraints for your content are in place at a time when your custom view’s properties aren’t changing.

Your implementation must be as efficient as possible. Don’t deactivate all your constraints, then reactivate the ones you need. Instead, your app must have some way of tracking your constraints, and validating them during each update pass. Only change items that need to be changed. During each update pass, you must ensure that you have the appropriate constraints for the app’s current state.

Don’t call `setNeedsUpdateConstraints()` inside your implementation. Calling `setNeedsUpdateConstraints()` schedules another update pass, creating a feedback loop.

In iOS 18 and later, UIKit supports automatic trait tracking inside this method for traits from this view’s `traitCollection`. For more information, see Automatic trait tracking.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/alignmentrect(forframe:)

#app-main)

- alignmentRect(forFrame:)

Instance Method

# alignmentRect(forFrame:)

Returns the view’s alignment rectangle for a given frame.

tvOS

@MainActor

## Parameters

`frame`

The frame whose corresponding alignment rectangle is desired.

## Return Value

The alignment rectangle for the specified frame.

## Discussion

The constraint-based layout system uses alignment rectangles to align views, rather than their frame. This allows custom views to be aligned based on the location of their content while still having a frame that encompasses any ornamentation they need to draw around their content, such as shadows or reflections.

The default implementation returns the view’s frame modified by the view’s `alignmentRectInsets`. Most custom views can use `alignmentRectInsets` to specify the location of their content within their frame. Custom views that require arbitrary transformations can override `alignmentRect(forFrame:)` and `frame(forAlignmentRect:)` to describe the location of their content. These two methods must always be inverses of each other.

## Parameters

`gestureRecognizer`

The gesture recognizer that’s attempting to transition out of the `UIGestureRecognizer.State.possible` state.

## Return Value

`true` if the gesture recognizer should continue tracking touch events and use them to trigger a gesture or `false` if it should transition to the `UIGestureRecognizer.State.failed` state.

## Discussion

Subclasses may override this method and use it to prevent the recognition of particular gestures. For example, the `UISlider` class uses this method to prevent swipes parallel to the slider’s travel direction and that start in the thumb.

At the time this method is called, the gesture recognizer is in the `UIGestureRecognizer.State.possible` state and thinks it has the events needed to move to the `UIGestureRecognizer.State.began` state.

## Parameters

`touches`

A set of `UITouch` instances that represent the touches whose values changed. These touches all belong to the specified `event`. For touches in a view, this set contains only one touch by default. To receive multiple touches, you must set the view’s `isMultipleTouchEnabled` property to `true`.

`event`

## Discussion

UIKit calls this method when the location or force of a touch changes. Many UIKit classes override this method and use it to handle the corresponding touch events. The default implementation of this method forwards the message up the responder chain. When creating your own subclasses, call `super` to forward any events that you don’t handle yourself, like in the following code.

super.touchesMoved(touches, with: event)

[super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event];

If you override this method without calling `super` (a common use pattern), you must also override the other methods for handling touch events, even if your implementations do nothing.

## Discussion

UIKit calls this method when it receives a system interruption requiring cancellation of the touch sequence. An interruption is anything that causes the application to become inactive or causes the view handling the touch events to be removed from its window. Your implementation of this method should clean up any state associated with handling the touch sequence. The default implementation of this method forwards the message up the responder chain. When creating your own subclasses, call `super` to forward any events that you don’t handle yourself, like in the following code.

- addConstraint(\_:)

Instance Method

# addConstraint(\_:)

Adds a constraint on the layout of the receiving view or its subviews.

tvOS

@MainActor
func addConstraint(_ constraint: NSLayoutConstraint)

## Parameters

`constraint`

The constraint to be added to the view. The constraint may only reference the view itself or its subviews.

## Discussion

The constraint must involve only views that are within scope of the receiving view. Specifically, any views involved must be either the receiving view itself, or a subview of the receiving view. Constraints that are added to a view are said to be held by that view. The coordinate system used when evaluating the constraint is the coordinate system of the view that holds the constraint.

When developing for iOS 8.0 or later, set the constraint’s `isActive` property to `true` instead of calling the `addConstraint(_:)` method directly. The `isActive` property automatically adds and removes the constraint from the correct view.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/autoresizingmask-swift.property

- UIKit

Instance Property

# autoresizingMask

An integer bit mask that determines how the receiver resizes itself when its superview’s bounds change.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
var autoresizingMask: UIView.AutoresizingMask { get set }

## Discussion

When a view’s bounds change, that view automatically resizes its subviews according to each subview’s autoresizing mask. You specify the value of this mask by combining the constants described in `UIView.AutoresizingMask` using the C bitwise OR operator. Combining these constants lets you specify which dimensions of the view should grow or shrink relative to the superview. The default value of this property is `UIViewAutoresizingNone`, which indicates that the view should not be resized at all.

When more than one option along the same axis is set, the default behavior is to distribute the size difference proportionally among the flexible portions. The larger the flexible portion, relative to the other flexible portions, the more it is likely to grow. For example, suppose this property includes the `flexibleWidth` and `flexibleRightMargin` constants but does not include the `flexibleLeftMargin` constant, thus indicating that the width of the view’s left margin is fixed but that the view’s width and right margin may change. Thus, the view appears anchored to the left side of its superview while both the view width and the gap to the right of the view increase.

If the autoresizing behaviors do not offer the precise layout that you need for your views, you can use a custom container view and override its `layoutSubviews()` method to position your subviews more precisely.

Instead of redrawing the contents of the view every time, you can use this property to specify that you want to scale the contents (either with or without distortion) or pin them to a particular spot on the view.

For a list of values you can assign to this property, see `UIView.ContentMode`. The default value of this property is `UIView.ContentMode.scaleToFill`.

Instance Property

# isHidden

A Boolean value that determines whether the view is hidden.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
var isHidden: Bool { get set }

## Discussion

Setting the value of this property to `true` hides the receiver and setting it to `false` shows the receiver. The default value is `false`.

A hidden view disappears from its window and does not receive input events. It remains in its superview’s list of subviews, however, and participates in autoresizing as usual. Hiding a view with subviews has the effect of hiding those subviews and any view descendants they might have. This effect is implicit and does not alter the hidden state of the receiver’s descendants.

Hiding the view that is the window’s current first responder causes the view’s next valid key view to become the new first responder.

The value of this property reflects the state of the receiver only and does not account for the state of the receiver’s ancestors in the view hierarchy. Thus this property can be `false` but the receiver may still be hidden if an ancestor is hidden.

## Discussion

If the system cannot find a nondefault color in the hierarchy, this property’s value is a system-defined color instead.

If the view’s `tintAdjustmentMode` property’s value is `UIView.TintAdjustmentMode.dimmed`, then the `tintColor` property value is automatically dimmed.

To refresh subview rendering when this property changes, override the `tintColorDidChange()` method.

Colors that are pattern colors (as described in `UIColor`) are not supported.

## Discussion

When this property’s value is `UIView.TintAdjustmentMode.dimmed`, the value of the `tintColor` property is modified to provide a dimmed appearance.

If the system cannot find a non-default value in the subview hierarchy when you query this property, the value is `UIView.TintAdjustmentMode.normal`.

When this property’s value changes (either by the view’s value changing or by one of its superview’s values changing), the system calls the `tintColorDidChange()` method to allow the view to refresh its rendering.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
var clearsContextBeforeDrawing: Bool { get set }

## Discussion

When set to `true`, the drawing buffer is automatically cleared to transparent black before the `draw(_:)` method is called. This behavior ensures that there are no visual artifacts left over when the view’s contents are redrawn. If the view’s `isOpaque` property is also set to `true`, the `backgroundColor` property of the view must not be `nil` or drawing errors may occur. The default value of this property is `true`.

If you set the value of this property to `false`, you are responsible for ensuring the contents of the view are drawn properly in your `draw(_:)` method. If your drawing code is already heavily optimized, setting this property is `false` can improve performance, especially during scrolling when only a portion of the view might need to be redrawn.

## Discussion

When set to `true`, the view receives all touches associated with a multi-touch sequence and starting within the view’s bounds. When set to `false`, the view receives only the first touch event in a multi-touch sequence that start within the view’s bounds. The default value of this property is `false`.

Other views in the same window can still receive touch events when this property is `false`. If you want this view to handle multi-touch events exclusively, set the values of both this property and the `isExclusiveTouch` property to `true`. This property does not prevent a view from being asked to handle multiple touches. For example, two subviews may both forward their touches to a common parent, such as a window or the root view of a view controller. This property determines how many touches initially targeting the view are delivered to that view.

You specify the value for this property using the unit coordinate space, where ( `0`, `0`) is the bottom-left corner of the view’s `bounds` rectangle, and ( `1`, `1`) is the top-right corner. The default value of this property is ( `0.5`, `0.5`), which represents the center of the view’s `bounds` rectangle.

All geometric manipulations to the view occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a view with the default anchor point causes the view to rotate around its center. Changing the anchor point to a different location causes the view to rotate around that new point.

# Positioning content within layout margins

Position views so that they aren’t crowded by other content.

## Overview

Layout margins provide a visual buffer between a view’s content and any content outside of the view’s bounds. The layout margins consist of inset values for each edge (top, bottom, leading, and trailing) of the view. These inset values create a space between the edges of the view’s bounds rectangle and the content inside the view. The following image shows two views with different sets of layout margins. Apart from the empty space they add around your content, margins have no visible representation.

To set up constraints that respect the layout margins, enable the `Constrain to margins` option in Xcode, as shown in the following image. (If you don’t enable that option, Xcode creates your constraints relative to the view’s bounds rectangle.) If the superview’s margins change later, the positions of elements tied to those margins are updated accordingly.

Even if you aren’t using constraints to position your content, you can still manually position content relative to a view’s layout margins. The `directionalLayoutMargins` property of each view contains the edge inset values to use for the view’s margins. Take those margin values into account when computing the position of items in your view.

### Change the default layout margins

UIKit provides default layout margins for each view, but you can change the default values to values that are more appropriate for your view. To change a view’s margin values, update the view’s `directionalLayoutMargins` property. (You can also use the Size inspector to set the value of that property at design time. In the Layout Margins section, choose the Language Directional option and enter the margin values for each of the view’s edges, as shown in the following image.)

For the root view of a view controller, UIKit enforces a set of minimum layout margins to ensure that content is displayed correctly. When the values in the `directionalLayoutMargins` property are less than the minimum values, UIKit uses the minimum values instead. You can get the minimum margin values from the `systemMinimumLayoutMargins` property of the view controller. To prevent UIKit from applying the minimum margins altogether, set the `viewRespectsSystemMinimumLayoutMargins` property of your view controller to false.

The view’s actual margins are computed using the view’s configuration and the value of its `directionalLayoutMargins` property. A view’s margins are affected by the settings of its `insetsLayoutMarginsFromSafeArea` and `preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins` properties, which can increase the default margin values to ensure appropriate spacing of your content.

@MainActor
var directionalLayoutMargins: NSDirectionalEdgeInsets { get set }

## Mentioned in

Positioning content within layout margins

## Discussion

Use this property to specify the desired amount of space (measured in points) between the edges of this view and its subviews. The leading and trailing margins are applied appropriately to the left or right margins based on the current layout direction. For example, the leading margin is applied to the right edge of the view in right-to-left layouts. For most views, the default layout margins are 8 points on each side. You can change these values as needed for your interface.

For the root view of a view controller, the default value of this property reflects the system minimum margins and safe area insets. For other subviews in your view hierarchy, the default layout margins are normally 8 points on each side, but the values may be greater if the view is not fully inside the safe area or if the `preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins` property is `true`.

Auto layout uses your margins as a cue for placing content. For example, if you specify a set of horizontal constraints using the format string “ `|-[subview]-|`”, the leading and trailing edges of the subview are inset from the edge of the superview by the corresponding layout margins. When the edge of your view is close to the edge of the superview and the `preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins` property is true, the actual layout margins may be increased to prevent content from overlapping the superview’s margins.

# layoutMargins

The default spacing to use when laying out content in the view.

tvOS

@MainActor
var layoutMargins: UIEdgeInsets { get set }

## Discussion

In iOS 11 and later, use the `directionalLayoutMargins` property to specify layout margins instead of this property. The leading and trailing edge insets in the `directionalLayoutMargins` property are synchronized with the left and right insets in this property. For example, setting the `leading` directional edge inset to 20 points causes the `left` inset of this property to be set to 20 points on a system with a left-to-right language.

For the root view of a view controller, the default value of this property reflects the system minimum margins and safe area insets. For other subviews in your view hierarchy, the default layout margins are normally 8 points on each side, but the values may be greater if the view is not fully inside the safe area or if the `preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins` property is `true`.

This property specifies the desired amount of space (measured in points) between the edge of the view and any subviews. Auto layout uses your margins as a cue for placing content. For example, if you specify a set of horizontal constraints using the format string “ `|-[subview]-|`”, the left and right edges of the subview are inset from the edge of the superview by the corresponding layout margins. When the edge of your view is close to the edge of the superview and the `preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins` property is `true`, the actual layout margins may be increased to prevent content from overlapping the superview’s margins.

var preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins: Bool { get set }

## Mentioned in

Positioning content within layout margins

## Discussion

When the value of this property is `true`, the superview’s margins are also considered when laying out content. This margin affects layouts where the distance between the edge of a view and its superview is smaller than the corresponding margin. For example, you might have a content view whose frame precisely matches the bounds of its superview. When any of the superview’s margins is inside the area represented by the content view and its own margins, UIKit adjusts the content view’s layout to respect the superview’s margins. The amount of the adjustment is the smallest amount needed to ensure that content is also inside the superview’s margins.

The default value of this property is `false`.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method does nothing. Subclasses can override this method and use it to respond when the value in the view’s `layoutMargins` property changes. For example, you might override this method if your view subclass handles layout manually or uses the layout margins during drawing. In both cases, you could use this method to initiate a drawing or layout update.

# safeAreaInsets

The insets that you use to determine the safe area for this view.

@MainActor
var safeAreaInsets: UIEdgeInsets { get }

## Mentioned in

Positioning content relative to the safe area

## Discussion

The safe area of a view reflects the area not covered by navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, and other ancestors that obscure a view controller’s view. (In tvOS, the safe area reflects the area not covered by the screen’s bezel.) You obtain the safe area for a view by applying the insets in this property to the view’s bounds rectangle. If the view is not currently installed in a view hierarchy, or is not yet visible onscreen, the edge insets in this property are `0`.

For the view controller’s root view, the insets account for the status bar, other visible bars, and any additional insets that you specified using the `additionalSafeAreaInsets` property of your view controller. For other views in the view hierarchy, the insets reflect only the portion of the view that is covered. For example, if a view is entirely within the safe area of its superview, the edge insets in this property are `0`.

You might use this property at runtime to adjust the position of your view’s content programmatically.

## Discussion

When the view is visible onscreen, this guide reflects the portion of the view that is not covered by navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, and other ancestor views. (In tvOS, the safe area reflects the area not covered the screen’s bezel.) If the view is not currently installed in a view hierarchy, or is not yet visible onscreen, the layout guide edges are equal to the edges of the view.

For the view controller’s root view, the layout guide accommodates the status bar, other visible bars, and any additional insets that you specified using the `additionalSafeAreaInsets` property of your view controller. For other views in the view hierarchy, the layout guide reflects only the portion of the view that is covered by other content. For example, if a view is entirely within the safe area of its superview, the layout guide edges are equal to the edges of the view.

## Discussion

This layout guide defines an area that can easily be read without forcing users to move their head to track the lines. The readable content area follows the following rules:

1. The readable content guide never extends beyond the view’s layout margin guide.

2. The readable content guide is vertically centered inside the layout margin guide.

3. The readable content guide’s width is equal to or less than the readable width defined for the current dynamic text size.

Use the readable content guide to lay out a single column of text. If you are laying out multiple columns, you can use the guide’s width to determine the optimal width for your columns.

## Parameters

`priority`

The new priority.

`axis`

The axis for which the compression resistance priority should be set.

## Discussion

Custom views should set default values for both orientations on creation, based on their content, typically to `UILayoutPriorityDefaultLow` or `UILayoutPriorityDefaultHigh`. When creating user interfaces, the layout designer can modify these priorities for specific views when the overall layout design requires different tradeoffs than the natural priorities of the views being used in the interface.

Subclasses should not override this method.

Instance Property

# alignmentRectInsets

The insets from the view’s frame that define its alignment rectangle.

tvOS

@MainActor
var alignmentRectInsets: UIEdgeInsets { get }

## Discussion

The default value of this property is an `UIEdgeInsets` structure with zero values. Custom views that draw ornamentation around their content should use this property to return insets that align with the edges of the content, excluding the ornamentation. This allows the constraint-based layout system to align views based on their content, rather than just their frame.

Custom views whose content location can’t be expressed by a simple set of insets should override `alignmentRect(forFrame:)` and `frame(forAlignmentRect:)` to describe their custom transform between alignment rectangle and frame.

## Discussion

For views with multiple rows of text, the first baseline is the baseline for the topmost row.

When you make a constraint to a view’s `NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute.firstBaseline` attribute, Auto Layout uses the baseline of the view returned by this method. If that view does not have a baseline, Auto Layout uses the view’s top edge.

Override this property to return a text-based subview (for example, `UILabel` or a nonscrolling `UITextView`). The returned view must be a subview of the receiver. The default implementation returns the value contained by `forLastBaselineLayout`.

## Discussion

When a property of your custom view changes in a way that would impact constraints, you can call this method to indicate that the constraints need to be updated at some point in the future. The system will then call `updateConstraints()` as part of its normal layout pass. Use this as an optimization tool to batch constraint changes. Updating constraints all at once just before they are needed ensures that you don’t needlessly recalculate constraints when multiple changes are made to your view in between layout passes.

Instance Property

# hasAmbiguousLayout

A Boolean value that determines whether the constraints impacting the layout of the view incompletely specify the location of the view.

tvOS

@MainActor
var hasAmbiguousLayout: Bool { get }

## Discussion

The value of this property is `true` if the view’s location is incompletely specified, `false` otherwise.

If there aren’t enough constraints in the system to uniquely determine layout, the layout is considered ambiguous. For example, if the only constraint in the system is `x = y + 100`, the layout is ambiguous because there are many possible values for `x` and `y`. UIKit does not automatically detect every ambiguous layout, so you may need to look for symptoms of ambiguity, such as views that jump from place to place, or that are in the wrong place.

This property should only be used for debugging constraint-based layout. No app should ship with usage of this property as part of its operation.

## Discussion

This method randomly changes the frame of a view with an ambiguous layout between its different valid values, causing the view to move in the interface. This makes it easy to visually identify what the valid frames are and may enable the developer to discern what constraints need to be added to the layout to fully specify a location for the view.

This method should only be used for debugging constraint-based layout. No application should ship with calls to this method as part of its operation.

@MainActor

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method does nothing on iOS 5.1 and earlier. Otherwise, the default implementation uses any constraints you’ve set to determine the size and position of any subviews.

Subclasses can override this method as needed to perform more precise layout of their subviews. You should override this method only if the autoresizing and constraint-based behaviors of the subviews don’t offer the behavior you want. You can use your implementation to set the frame rectangles of your subviews directly.

You shouldn’t call this method directly. If you want to force a layout update, call the `setNeedsLayout()` method instead to do so prior to the next drawing update. If you want to update the layout of your views immediately, call the `layoutIfNeeded()` method.

In iOS 18 and later, UIKit supports automatic trait tracking inside this method for traits from this view’s `traitCollection`. For more information, see Automatic trait tracking.

## Discussion

Use this method to force the view to update its layout immediately. When using Auto Layout, the layout engine updates the position of views as needed to satisfy changes in constraints. Using the view that receives the message as the root view, this method lays out the view subtree starting at the root. If no layout updates are pending, this method exits without modifying the layout or calling any layout-related callbacks.

Instance Property

# translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints

A Boolean value that determines whether the view’s autoresizing mask is translated into Auto Layout constraints.

tvOS

@MainActor
var translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints: Bool { get set }

## Discussion

If this property’s value is `true`, the system creates a set of constraints that duplicate the behavior specified by the view’s autoresizing mask. This also lets you modify the view’s size and location using the view’s `frame`, `bounds`, or `center` properties, allowing you to create a static, frame-based layout within Auto Layout.

Note that the autoresizing mask constraints fully specify the view’s size and position; therefore, you cannot add additional constraints to modify this size or position without introducing conflicts. If you want to use Auto Layout to dynamically calculate the size and position of your view, you must set this property to `false`, and then provide a non ambiguous, nonconflicting set of constraints for the view.

By default, the property is set to `true` for any view you programmatically create. If you add views in Interface Builder, the system automatically sets this property to `false`.

Choosing a specific interface style for your iOS app

## Discussion

Use this property to force the view to always adopt a light or dark interface style. The default value of this property is `UIUserInterfaceStyle.unspecified`, which causes the view to inherit the interface style from a parent view or view controller. If you assign a different value, the new style applies to the view and all of the subviews owned by the same view controller. (If the view hierarchy contains the root view of an embedded child view controller, the child view controller and its views do not inherit the interface style.) If the view is a `UIWindow` object, the new style applies to everything in the window, including the root view controller and all presented content.

## Discussion

Some views should not flip when switching between left-to-right and right-to-left layouts. For example, the view is part of the playback controls or represents physical directions (up, down, left, right) that don’t change. Instead of thinking about whether or not a view should change its orientation, select the semantic content attribute that best describes your view.

When creating a view that contains subviews, you can use the `userInterfaceLayoutDirection(for:)` class method to determine whether the subviews should be flipped, and lay out the views in the appropriate order.

For example, when this method is passed a layout direction of `UIUserInterfaceLayoutDirection.rightToLeft` and a semantic content attribute of `UISemanticContentAttribute.playback`, it returns `UIUserInterfaceLayoutDirection.leftToRight`.

# UIView.Invalidating

A property wrapper that notifies the system that a property value change has invalidated an aspect of the containing view.

Mac CatalystvisionOSSwift 5.1+

@propertyWrapper

## Overview

Use this wrapper when a change in the property value invalidates the display, layout, configuration, constraints, or intrinsic sizing of a view. This wrapper performs any actions necessary to notify the system that your view is invalid and requires an update. The actions depend on the invalidation types you specify. For more information on available invalidation types, see `UIViewInvalidating`.

The following example uses the `UIView.Invalidating` wrapper with the `display` type on the property `badgeColor` and the `display` and `layout` type on the property `badgePosition`.

class MyView: UIView {
@Invalidating(.display) var badgeColor: UIColor

@Invalidating(.display, .layout) var badgePosition: UIRectEdge
}

When you change the badge color, the property wrapper calls `setNeedsDisplay()`, causing the system to redraw the view. When you change the badge position, the property wrapper also calls `setNeedsLayout()`, causing the system to update the view’s subviews before it redraws.

Functions such as `setNeedsDisplay()` and `setNeedsLayout()` perform changes on the next update cycle. You can make changes to multiple properties and views before any of those views update. Consolidating the updates to one update cycle is usually better for performance.

Instance Property

# canBecomeFocused

A Boolean value that indicates whether the view is currently capable of being focused.

@MainActor
var canBecomeFocused: Bool { get }

## Discussion

The value of this property is `true` if the view can become focused; `false` otherwise.

By default, the value of this property is `false`. This property informs the focus engine if a view is capable of being focused. Sometimes even if a view returns `true`, a view may not be focusable for the following reasons:

- The view is hidden.

- The view has alpha set to 0.

- The view has `userInteractionEnabled` set to `false`.

- The view is not currently in the view hierarchy.

Instance Property

# restorationIdentifier

The identifier that determines whether the view supports state restoration.

tvOS

@MainActor
var restorationIdentifier: String? { get set }

## Discussion

This property indicates whether state information in the view should be preserved; it is also used to identify the view during the restoration process. The value of this property is `nil` by default, which indicates that the view’s state does not need to be saved. Assigning a string object to the property lets the owning view controller know that the view has relevant state information to save.

Assign a value to this property only if you are implementing a custom view that implements the `encodeRestorableState(with:)` and `decodeRestorableState(with:)` methods for saving and restoring state. You use those methods to write any view-specific state information and subsequently use that data to restore the view to its previous configuration.

- UIView
- encodeRestorableState(with:)

Instance Method

# encodeRestorableState(with:)

Encodes state-related information for the view.

tvOS

@MainActor
func encodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder)

## Parameters

`coder`

The coder object to use to encode the state of the view.

## Discussion

If your app supports state preservation, you can override this method for any views that have state information that should be saved between launches of your app. You should save only the data required to return the view to its current configuration. Do not save the view object itself and do not save any data that could be determined by other means at launch time.

Few views should need to save state information. Most views should just be configured using the data from their view controller. However, this method is available for those views that have user-configurable state that would be otherwise lost between app launches.

Your implementation of this method can encode other restorable view and view controller objects that it needs to reference. Encoding a restorable view or view controller writes that object’s restoration identifier to the coder. (That identifier is used during the decode process to locate the new version of the object.) If the view or view controller defines its own version of this method, that method is also called at some point so that the object can encode its own state.

Apart from views and view controllers, other objects follow the normal serialization process and must adopt the `NSCoding` protocol before they can be encoded. Encoding such objects embeds the object’s contents in the archive directly. During the decode process, a new object is created and initialized with the data from the archive.

It is recommended that you call `super` at some point during your implementation to give parent classes an opportunity to save their state information.

- resizableSnapshotView(from:afterScreenUpdates:withCapInsets:)

Instance Method

# resizableSnapshotView(from:afterScreenUpdates:withCapInsets:)

Returns a snapshot view based on the specified contents of the current view, with stretchable insets.

tvOS

@MainActor
func resizableSnapshotView(
from rect: CGRect,
afterScreenUpdates afterUpdates: Bool,
withCapInsets capInsets: UIEdgeInsets

## Parameters

`rect`

The portion of the view that you want to capture. The rectangle must be in the bounds coordinate space of the current view.

`afterUpdates`

A Boolean value that specifies whether the snapshot should be taken after recent changes have been incorporated. Pass the value `false` if you want to capture the screen in its current state, which might not include recent changes.

`capInsets`

The edge insets that define the stretchable portion of the returned view’s content. You can specify `zero` if you do not want the contents of the returned view to have a stretchable area.

## Return Value

A new view object containing a snapshot of the current view’s rendered contents.

## Discussion

This method very efficiently captures the current rendered appearance of a view and uses it to build a new snapshot view with stretchable insets. You can use the returned view as a visual stand-in for the current view in your app. For example, you might use a snapshot view for animations where updating a large view hierarchy might be expensive. Because the content is captured from the already rendered content, this method reflects the current visual appearance of the view and is not updated to reflect animations that are scheduled or in progress. However, calling this method is faster than trying to render the contents of the current view into a bitmap image yourself.

Because the returned snapshot is a view object, you can modify it and its layer object as needed. However, you cannot change the `contents` property of the snapshot view’s layer; attempts to do so fail silently. If the current view is not yet rendered, perhaps because it is not yet onscreen, the snapshot view has no visible content.

You can call this method on a previously generated snapshot to obtain a new snapshot. For example, you could do so after you change properties of a previous snapshot (such as its alpha value) and want a new snapshot that includes those changes.

If you want to apply a graphical effect, such as blur, to a snapshot, use the `drawHierarchy(in:afterScreenUpdates:)` method instead.

If you specify nonzero edge insets in the `capInsets` parameter, those values determine the returned snapshot’s stretchable content area.

tvOS

@MainActor
func drawHierarchy(

## Parameters

`rect`

A rectangle specified in the local coordinate system (bounds) of the view.

`afterUpdates`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the snapshot should be rendered after recent changes have been incorporated. Specify the value `false` if you want to render a snapshot in the view hierarchy’s current state, which might not include recent changes.

## Return Value

Returns `true` if the snapshot is complete, or `false` if the snapshot is missing image data for any view in the hierarchy.

## Discussion

Use this method when you want to apply a graphical effect, such as a blur, to a view snapshot. This method is not as fast as the `snapshotView(afterScreenUpdates:)` method.

## Discussion

This method looks at the current view and its subview hierarchy for the text field that is currently the first responder. If it finds one, it asks that text field to resign as first responder. If the `force` parameter is set to `true`, the text field is never even asked; it is forced to resign.

Instance Property

# accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors

A Boolean value indicating whether the view ignores an accessibility request to invert its colors.

@MainActor

## Discussion

Inverting colors is often used to help users with light or color sensitivities to make bright colors darker. However, this behavior can have a destructive impact on images and videos. If inverting the colors would have a negative impact on your view’s content, set this property to `true` to prevent it from inverting its colors. Setting the property to `true` prevents the system from inverting the colors of the view and all of its subviews.

- animate(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)

Type Method

# animate(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)

Animate changes to one or more views using the specified duration, delay, options, and completion handler.

tvOS

@MainActor
class func animate(
withDuration duration: TimeInterval,
delay: TimeInterval,
options: UIView.AnimationOptions = [],

)

## Parameters

`duration`

The total duration of the animations, measured in seconds. If you specify a negative value or `0`, the changes are made without animating them.

`delay`

The amount of time (measured in seconds) to wait before beginning the animations. Specify a value of `0` to begin the animations immediately.

`options`

A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see `UIView.AnimationOptions`.

`animations`

A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. This is where you programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `NULL`.

`completion`

A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be `NULL`.

## Discussion

This method initiates a set of animations to perform on the view. The block object in the `animations` parameter contains the code for animating the properties of one or more views.

During an animation, user interactions are temporarily disabled for the views being animated. (Prior to iOS 5, user interactions are disabled for the entire application.) If you want users to be able to interact with the views, include the `allowUserInteraction` constant in the `options` parameter.

- UIView
- transition(from:to:duration:options:completion:)

Type Method

# transition(from:to:duration:options:completion:)

Creates a transition animation between the specified views using the given parameters.

tvOS

@MainActor
class func transition(
from fromView: UIView,
to toView: UIView,
duration: TimeInterval,
options: UIView.AnimationOptions = [],

)

## Parameters

`fromView`

The starting view for the transition. By default, this view is removed from its superview as part of the transition.

`toView`

The ending view for the transition. By default, this view is added to the superview of `fromView` as part of the transition.

`duration`

The duration of the transition animation, measured in seconds. If you specify a negative value or `0`, the transition is made without animations.

`options`

A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see `UIView.AnimationOptions`.

`completion`

A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be `NULL`.

## Discussion

This method provides a simple way to transition from the view in the `fromView` parameter to the view in the `toView` parameter. By default, the view in `fromView` is replaced in the view hierarchy by the view in `toView`. If both views are already part of your view hierarchy, you can include the `showHideTransitionViews` option in the `options` parameter to simply hide or show them.

This method modifies the views in their view hierarchy only. It does not modify your application’s view controllers in any way. For example, if you use this method to change the root view displayed by a view controller, it is your responsibility to update the view controller appropriately to handle the change.

The view transition starts immediately unless another animation is already in-flight, in which case it starts immediately after the current animation finishes.

During an animation, user interactions are temporarily disabled for the views being animated. (Prior to iOS 5, user interactions are disabled for the entire application.) If you want users to be able to interact with the views, include the `allowUserInteraction` constant in the `options` parameter.

- animateKeyframes(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)

Type Method

# animateKeyframes(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)

Creates an animation block object that can be used to set up keyframe-based animations for the current view.

tvOS

@MainActor
class func animateKeyframes(
withDuration duration: TimeInterval,
delay: TimeInterval,
options: UIView.KeyframeAnimationOptions = [],

)
@MainActor
class func animateKeyframes(
withDuration duration: TimeInterval,
delay: TimeInterval,
options: UIView.KeyframeAnimationOptions = [],

## Parameters

`duration`

The duration of the overall animation, measured in seconds. If you specify a negative value or `0`, changes are made immediately and without animations.

`delay`

Specifies the time (in seconds) to wait before starting the animation.

`options`

A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see `UIView.KeyframeAnimationOptions`.

`animations`

A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. Typically, you call the `addKeyframe(withRelativeStartTime:relativeDuration:animations:)` method one or more times from inside this block. You may also change view values directly if you want those changes to animate over the full duration. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. Do not use a `nil` value for this parameter.

`completion`

A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. You can use a `nil` value for this parameter.

## Discussion

This method creates an animation block that you can use to set up a keyframe-based animation. The keyframes themselves are not part of the initial animation block you create using this method. Inside the `animations` block, you must add the keyframe time and animation data by calling the `addKeyframe(withRelativeStartTime:relativeDuration:animations:)` method one or more times. Adding keyframes causes the animation to animate the view from its current value to the value of the first keyframe, then to the value of the next keyframe, and so on at the times you specify.

If you do not add any keyframes in the `animations` block, the animation proceeds from start to end like a standard animation block. In other words, the system animates from the current view values to any new values over the specified `duration`.

- addKeyframe(withRelativeStartTime:relativeDuration:animations:)

Type Method

# addKeyframe(withRelativeStartTime:relativeDuration:animations:)

Specifies the timing and animation values for a single frame of a keyframe animation.

tvOS

@MainActor
class func addKeyframe(
withRelativeStartTime frameStartTime: Double,
relativeDuration frameDuration: Double,

)

## Parameters

`frameStartTime`

The time at which to start the specified animations. This value must be in the range `0` to `1`, where `0` represents the start of the overall animation and `1` represents the end of the overall animation. For example, for an animation that is two seconds in duration, specifying a start time of `0.5` causes the animations to begin executing one second after the start of the overall animation.

`frameDuration`

The length of time over which to animate to the specified value. This value must be in the range `0` to `1` and indicates the amount of time relative to the overall animation length. If you specify a value of `0`, any properties you set in the `animations` block update immediately at the specified start time. If you specify a nonzero value, the properties animate over that amount of time. For example, for an animation that is two seconds in duration, specifying a duration of `0.5` results in an animation duration of one second.

`animations`

A block object containing the animations you want to perform. This is where you programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `nil`.

## Discussion

To animate view properties during a keyframe animation, call this method from within the animation block you pass to the `animateKeyframes(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)` method. To animate between different values, or to tweak the timing of your view property animations, you can call this method multiple times within a block.

The view properties you change in the `animations` block animate over the timespan you specify in `frameDuration` parameter. The properties do not begin animating until the time you specify in the `frameStartTime` parameter. After the frame start time, the animation executes over its specified duration or until interrupted by another animation.

Performs a view animation using a timing curve corresponding to the motion of a physical spring.

tvOS

@MainActor
class func animate(
withDuration duration: TimeInterval,
delay: TimeInterval,
usingSpringWithDamping dampingRatio: CGFloat,
initialSpringVelocity velocity: CGFloat,
options: UIView.AnimationOptions = [],

)

## Parameters

`duration`

The total duration of the animations, measured in seconds. If you specify a negative value or `0`, the changes are made without animating them.

`delay`

The amount of time (measured in seconds) to wait before beginning the animations. Specify a value of `0` to begin the animations immediately.

`dampingRatio`

The damping ratio for the spring animation as it approaches its quiescent state.

To smoothly decelerate the animation without oscillation, use a value of `1`. Employ a damping ratio closer to zero to increase oscillation.

`velocity`

The initial spring velocity. For smooth start to the animation, match this value to the view’s velocity as it was prior to attachment.

A value of `1` corresponds to the total animation distance traversed in one second. For example, if the total animation distance is 200 points and you want the start of the animation to match a view velocity of 100 pt/s, use a value of `0.5`.

`options`

A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see `UIView.AnimationOptions`.

`animations`

A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. This is where you programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `NULL`.

`completion`

A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be `NULL`.

- UIPopoverBackgroundView

Class

# UIPopoverBackgroundView

The background appearance for a popover.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIPopoverBackgroundView

## Overview

This class must be subclassed before it can be used. The implementation of your subclass is responsible for providing the border decoration and arrow for the popover. Subclasses must override all declared properties and methods to provide information about where to lay out the corresponding popover content and arrow. Subclasses must also provide implementations for all methods of the `UIPopoverBackgroundViewMethods` protocol.

### Subclassing notes

Your subclass is responsible for providing the background visual styling of the popover, which includes the arrow and appropriately styled border. The popover controller places the actual popover content on top of your background view to finish the popover’s presentation.

The background contents of your view should be based on stretchable images. Because the popover is animated into place (and may require animated transitions), using images is the only way to ensure that the animations are smooth and not jittery. By creating images that can be stretched at appropriate places, your popover can still be resized and adjusted as needed. You can then incorporate those images using `UIImageView` subviews or Core Animation layers. When the size of the popover changes (perhaps to accommodate the keyboard), all you have to do is adjust the frame rectangles of your embedded image views.

In addition to providing the background content, your subclass must implement the `arrowOffset` and `arrowDirection` properties and the methods in the `UIPopoverBackgroundViewMethods` protocol. The popover controller uses these methods and properties to get and set information related to your background view. The protocol methods are called once and the values you return should never change. However, the values in the `arrowOffset` and `arrowDirection` properties can change while your popover is on the screen, so your setter methods should call `setNeedsLayout()` when that happens to update the background image views or layers.

To create a stretchable image, use the `resizableImage(withCapInsets:)` method of `UIImage`.

## Topics

### Accessing the arrow metrics

`var arrowOffset: CGFloat`

The distance (measured in points) from the center of the view to the center line of the arrow.

`var arrowDirection: UIPopoverArrowDirection`

The direction in which the popover arrow is pointing.

### Controlling the popover appearance

`class var wantsDefaultContentAppearance: Bool`

Determines whether the default content appearance should be used for the popover.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewcell

Class

# UITableViewCell

The visual representation of a single row in a table view.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UITableViewCell

## Mentioned in

Filling a table with data

Configuring the cells for your table

Adding user-focusable elements to a tvOS app

## Overview

A `UITableViewCell` object is a specialized type of view that manages the content of a single table row. You use cells primarily to organize and present your app’s custom content, but `UITableViewCell` provides some specific customizations to support table-related behaviors, including:

- Applying a selection or highlight color to the cell

- Adding standard accessory views, such as a detail or disclosure control

- Putting the cell into an editable state

- Indenting the cell’s content to create a visual hierarchy in your table

Your app’s content occupies most of the cell’s bounds, but the cell may adjust that space to make room for other content. Cells display accessory views on the trailing edge of their content area. When you put your table into edit mode, the cell adds a delete control to the leading edge of its content area, and optionally swaps out an accessory view for a reorder control.

Every table view must have at least one type of cell for displaying content, and tables may have multiple cell types to display different types of content. Your table’s data source object handles the creation and configuration of cells immediately before they appear onscreen. For information about how to create your table’s cells, see Filling a table with data.

### Configure your cell’s content

Configure the content and layout of your cells in your storyboard file. Tables have one cell type by default, but you can add more by changing the value in the table’s Prototype Cells attribute. In addition to configuring the cell’s content, make sure you configure the following attributes:

- Identifier. Use this identifier (also known as a reuse identifier) to create the cell.

- Style. Choose one of the standard types or define a custom cell.

- Class. Specify a `UITableViewCell` subclass with your custom behavior.

To configure the content and appearance of your cell, you can set its `contentConfiguration` and `backgroundConfiguration`.

protocol UIAppearance : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

You can customize the appearance of instances of a class by sending appearance-modification messages to the class’s appearance proxy.

There are two ways to customize appearance for objects: for all instances, and for instances contained within an instance of a container class.

To customize the appearance of all instances of a class, use `appearance()` to get the appearance proxy for the class. For example, to modify the bar background tint color for all instances of `UINavigationBar`:

UINavigationBar.appearance().barTintColor = navBarTintColor

To customize the appearances for instances of a class when contained within an instance of a container class, or instances in a hierarchy, use `appearanceWhenContainedIn:` to get the appearance proxy for the class. For example, to modify the appearance of bar buttons, based on the object that contains the navigation bar:

let navigationBarAppearance =
UINavigationBar.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UINavigationController.self])
navigationBarAppearance.setBackgroundImage(navBarBackgroundImage, for: .any, barMetrics: .default)

let barButtonNavigationBarAppearance =
UIBarButtonItem.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UINavigationBar.self])
barButtonNavigationBarAppearance.setBackgroundImage(barButtonNavBarImage, for: .normal, barMetrics: .default)

let barButtonToolbarAppearance =
UIBarButtonItem.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UIToolbar.self])
barButtonToolbarAppearance.setBackgroundImage(barButtonToolbarImage, for: .normal, barMetrics: .default)

In any given view hierarchy, the outermost appearance proxy wins. Specificity (depth of the chain) is the tie-breaker. In other words, the containment statement in `appearanceWhenContainedIn:` is treated as a partial ordering. Given a concrete ordering (actual subview hierarchy), UIKit selects the partial ordering that’s the first unique match when reading the actual hierarchy from the window down.

You can further refine which instances of a class will have their appearance customized by specifying a trait collection. Use the `appearance(for:)` and `appearanceForTraitCollection:whenContainedIn:` methods to retrieve the proxy for a class with the specified trait collection.

To support appearance customization, a class must conform to the `UIAppearanceContainer` protocol and relevant accessor methods must be marked with `UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR`.

## Topics

Protocol

# UICoordinateSpace

A set of methods for converting between different frames of reference on a screen.

iOSiPadOStvOSvisionOSwatchOS

@MainActor
protocol UICoordinateSpace : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

The `UIView` class adopts this protocol so that you can convert easily between most coordinate spaces in your app. The `UIScreen` class includes the `coordinateSpace` and `fixedCoordinateSpace` properties, which give you access to the screen’s coordinate spaces. You can adopt this protocol in your own classes to convert between your custom coordinate spaces and the coordinate spaces of your app’s views and screens.

In iOS 8 and later, window and screen coordinate spaces aren’t fixed to a specific device orientation. Instead, window and screen coordinates change to match the app’s interface orientation, which typically (but not always) matches the current device orientation. (View controllers still determine which interface orientations the app supports.) Rotating the window and screen simplifies the interactions between views, windows, and the screen. In cases where you still need a fixed frame of reference — for example, because you need to store the location of a touch event or onscreen item persistently — you can use the methods of this protocol to convert coordinate values to the fixed coordinate space provided by the `UIScreen` object.

To convert a point from a view’s current coordinate space to the screen’s fixed coordinate space, use code similar to the following:

[myView convertPoint:point toCoordinateSpace:myView.window.screen.fixedCoordinateSpace];

When implementing the methods of this protocol, you must convert coordinate values to or from your local coordinate space. When performing such conversions, use the screen coordinate space as an intermediate coordinate space, converting to screen coordinates before converting to the target coordinate space. For example, when converting from your local coordinate space to the coordinate space of another view, convert your local coordinates to the screen coordinate space first and then convert those screen coordinates to the coordinate space of the view.

### Responding to focus updates

`func didUpdateFocus(in: UIFocusUpdateContext, with: UIFocusAnimationCoordinator)`

Called immediately after the system updates the focus to a new view.

### Controlling user-generated focus movements

[`var preferredFocusEnvironments: [any UIFocusEnvironment]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifocusenvironment/preferredfocusenvironments)

Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience

## Discussion

This method is called after the view controller has loaded its view hierarchy into memory. This method is called regardless of whether the view hierarchy was loaded from a nib file or created programmatically in the `loadView()` method. You usually override this method to perform additional initialization on views that were loaded from nib files.

Class

# UIColor

An object that stores color data and sometimes opacity.

tvOS

class UIColor

## Mentioned in

Customizing drawings

Determining color values with color spaces

Understanding a drag item as a promise

## Overview

Use color to customize your app’s appearance, communicate status, and help people visualize data. To learn more about using color in your apps, see Human Interface Guidelines.

`UIColor` provides a list of class properties that create adaptable and fixed colors such as blue, green, purple, and more. `UIColor` also offers properties to specify system-provided colors for UI elements such as labels, text, and buttons. You can create color objects by specifying color component values such as RGB, hue, and saturation. You can also create colors from other color objects and even create a pattern-based color from an image.

## Topics

### Getting existing colors

Choose colors for UI elements such as labels, text, backgrounds, and links.

Define standard color objects for specific shades, such as red, blue, green, black, white, and more.

Load colors from asset catalogs and create colors from raw component values.

### Applying the color to the drawing environment

Create custom colors and patterns for drawing in your app.

`func set()`

Sets the color of subsequent stroke and fill operations to the color that the receiver represents.

`func setFill()`

Sets the color of subsequent fill operations to the color that the receiver represents.

`func setStroke()`

Sets the color of subsequent stroke operations to the color that the receiver represents.

### Getting the color information

Change the system’s interpretation of a color value for display by selecting a color space.

`var cgColor: CGColor`

The Quartz color that corresponds to the color object.

`var ciColor: CIColor`

The Core Image color that corresponds to the color object.

Returns the components that form the color in the HSB color space.

Returns the components that form the color in the RGB color space.

Returns the grayscale components of the color.

`var linearExposure: CGFloat`

The linear brightness multiplier that was applied when generating this color. Colors created with an exposure by UIColor create CGColors that are tagged with a contentHeadroom value. While CGColors created without a contentHeadroom tag will return 0 from CGColorGetHeadroom, UIColors generated in a similar fashion return a linearExposure of 1.0.

Beta

`var accessibilityName: String`

A localized description of the color for accessibility attributes.

### Resolving a dynamically generated color

Returns the version of the current color that results from the specified traits.

### Working with color prominence

`var prominence: UIColor.Prominence`

Returns the version of the current color that results from applying the specified prominence.

`enum Prominence`

A type that indicates the prominence of a color in the interface.

### Working with high dynamic range (HDR) colors

# About focus interactions for Apple TV

Design and implement intuitive control schemes for menus and interactive user interface layouts.

## Overview

On iOS devices, a user interacts directly with the touchscreen. On Apple TV, a remote or other input device is used to control the interface indirectly. Focus refers to the effect onscreen of external, indirect user input from an input device. As the user navigates through the interface, the next focusable item in the direction in which the user is navigating becomes focused, which triggers a focus update. If the focused item is selectable, the user selects it with the remote. Certain items, such as tab bars, are automatically selected after a slight delay.

The UIKit framework supports focus-based interfaces only, and in most cases this behavior is automatically provided. For apps with custom user interface components, you need to implement custom focus behavior.

### Understanding the focus engine

The system within UIKit that controls focus and focus movement is called the focus engine. The focus engine listens for incoming focus-movement events in your app. When an event comes in, the focus engine automatically determines the next focusable item and notifies your app. This creates a consistent user experience across apps, provides automatic support for all current and future input methods, and helps developers concentrate on implementing their app’s unique behavior rather than defining or reinventing basic navigation.

Only the focus engine can explicitly update focus, meaning there’s no API for directly setting the focused item or moving focus in a particular direction. The focus engine updates focus only when the user sends a movement event or when the system or the app requests an update. Keep the following focus behaviors in mind when creating your layout design:

**Not all items are focusable.** If an item isn’t focusable, it’s ignored whenever focus is determined. Use the `canBecomeFocused` property to determine if an item is focusable.

**Only a single item can have focus at any given time.**

**Users change focus by selecting a direction on the remote.** UIKit then attempts to move the focus to a new user interface element in that direction. If the system finds another item that can accept focus in that direction, the found item gains focus. If no element is found in that direction, the currently focused item stays in focus and a `movementDidFailNotification` notification is broadcast.

**Only the user can directionally change focus.** Your app can’t programmatically search for a new element in a given direction. Although you can change focus programmatically, there are restrictions on how focus may change. Focus should almost always be under user control. For example, if the contents of a table view changed and the original focus element no longer exists, it’s reasonable to have your app programmatically select a new item to be in focus.

**Focus is managed by the focus environment.** When a focus environment gains focus, it can either keep the focus or give that focus to one of its own child focus environments. The focus environment it selects is its preferred focus environment. If a child focus environment is chosen, the child focus environment can also choose whether to keep focus or pass it to one of its child focus environments. This process drills down until a focus environment accepts focus for itself. The root view controller of the window also participates in the focus process. The root view controller’s `preferredFocusEnvironments` property is the first focus environment that’s selected to gain focus.

# Adding user-focusable elements to a tvOS app

Create intuitive and easily manipulated user-interactive controls for your tvOS app.

## Overview

On Apple TV, people use a remote or game controller to navigate through interface elements like movie posters, apps, or buttons, highlighting each item as they come to it. The highlighted item is said to be _focused_ or _in focus_. It appears elevated or otherwise distinct from other items. An item is considered focused when the user has highlighted it, but not selected it. The user moves focus by navigating through different UI items, which triggers a focus update.

### Add focusable items to the view

In Xcode, search the Library pane for the item you want to add to your app, and drag it to your app’s storyboard. Several UIKit elements are focusable by default, including buttons ( `UIButton`), text fields ( `UITextField`), and table cells ( `UITableViewCell`). The top-left item is in focus when your app launches. (In right-to-left languages, the top-right item is initially in focus.) You don’t need to do anything to UIKit elements that are focusable by default. However, you can add SceneKit and SpriteKit nodes as focusable elements. To make a SceneKit or SpriteKit node focusable, set the `focusBehavior` property of the node to `focusable`, as shown below.

node.focusBehavior = .focusable

### Design your layout in a grid pattern

The easiest way to ensure that focus moves between focusable items is to arrange the items in a grid pattern. Swiping on the remote triggers the focus engine—the system that controls focus and movement—to find all of the focusable items in the direction of the swipe. The first item found then becomes the newly focused item. The following image shows the items found by the focus engine when the user swipes right, and the resulting focused item.

The following image shows the items found by the focus engine when the user swipes down, and the resulting focused item.

When the focus engine doesn’t find any items in the direction of the swipe, by default the focused item doesn’t change, as shown in the following image.

When necessary, you can change the default behavior by using `UIFocusGuide` to redirect focus to other focusable items in the user interface.

## Overview

Use a `UIFocusSystem` object to obtain the focus-related state for the objects of your app. You can get state information for your app’s views, view controllers, windows, and other objects that adopt the `UIFocusEnvironment` protocol. The `UIFocusSystem` object lists the currently focused item, if any, for a window or view hierarchy. You can use it to force the system to update the focus state, and you can register custom sounds to be played during focus changes.

## Topics

### Getting a focus system object

`init?(for: any UIFocusEnvironment)`

Retrieves a focus system object that contains the state information for the specified object.

Deprecated

Retrieves the focus system for the specified environment.

### Getting the currently focused item

`var focusedItem: (any UIFocusItem)?`

The item that’s currently focused.

### Managing focus updates

`func requestFocusUpdate(to: any UIFocusEnvironment)`

Submits a request to update the focus state of the specified object.

`func updateFocusIfNeeded()`

Forces the system to act on a pending focus update for the current environment.

### Registering custom sounds

`class func register(URL, forSoundIdentifier: UIFocusSoundIdentifier)`

Registers the specified sound file with the focus engine.

### Responding to focus-related keys and notifications

`class let animationCoordinatorUserInfoKey: String`

Updates the animation coordinator.

The view that takes the focus after the focus update.

`var focusHeading: UIFocusHeading`

The heading in which the focus update is occurring.

`struct UIFocusHeading`

The general type of an event.

### Getting related focus items

`var previouslyFocusedItem: (any UIFocusItem)?`

The item that was focused before the update.

`var nextFocusedItem: (any UIFocusItem)?`

The item to be focused after the update.

- UIGestureRecognizer

Class

# UIGestureRecognizer

The base class for concrete gesture recognizers.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIGestureRecognizer

## Overview

A _gesture recognizer_ decouples the logic for recognizing a sequence of touches (or other input) and acting on that recognition. When one of these objects recognizes a common gesture or, in some cases, a change in the gesture, it sends an action message to each designated target object.

The concrete subclasses of `UIGestureRecognizer` are the following:

- `UITapGestureRecognizer`

- `UIPinchGestureRecognizer`

- `UIRotationGestureRecognizer`

- `UISwipeGestureRecognizer`

- `UIPanGestureRecognizer`

- `UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer`

- `UILongPressGestureRecognizer`

- `UIHoverGestureRecognizer`

The `UIGestureRecognizer` class defines a set of common behaviors that can be configured for all concrete gesture recognizers. It can also communicate with its delegate (an object that adopts the `UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` protocol), thereby enabling finer-grained customization of some behaviors.

A gesture recognizer operates on touches hit-tested to a specific view and all of that view’s subviews. It thus must be associated with that view. To make that association you must call the `UIView` method `addGestureRecognizer(_:)`. A gesture recognizer doesn’t participate in the view’s responder chain.

A gesture recognizer has one or more target-action pairs associated with it. If there are multiple target-action pairs, they’re discrete, and not cumulative. Recognition of a gesture results in the dispatch of an action message to a target for each of the associated pairs. The action methods invoked must conform to one of the following signatures:

@IBAction func myActionMethod()
@IBAction func myActionMethod(_ sender: UIGestureRecognizer)

- (IBAction)handleGesture;
- (IBAction)handleGesture:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer;

Methods conforming to the latter signature permit the target in some cases to query the gesture recognizer sending the message for additional information. For example, the target could ask a `UIRotationGestureRecognizer` object for the angle of rotation (in radians) since the last invocation of the action method for this gesture. Clients of gesture recognizers can also ask for the location of a gesture by calling `location(in:)` or `location(ofTouch:in:)`.

The gesture interpreted by a gesture recognizer can be either discrete or continuous. A discrete gesture, such as a double tap, occurs but once in a multi-touch sequence and results in a single action sent. However, when a gesture recognizer interprets a continuous gesture such as a rotation gesture, it sends an action message for each incremental change until the multi-touch sequence concludes.

A window delivers touch events to a gesture recognizer before it delivers them to the hit-tested view attached to the gesture recognizer. Generally, if a gesture recognizer analyzes the stream of touches in a multi-touch sequence and doesn’t recognize its gesture, the view receives the full complement of touches. If a gesture recognizer recognizes its gesture, the remaining touches for the view are canceled. The usual sequence of actions in gesture recognition follows a path determined by default values of the `cancelsTouchesInView`, `delaysTouchesBegan`, `delaysTouchesEnded` properties:

- `cancelsTouchesInView` — If a gesture recognizer recognizes its gesture, it unbinds the remaining touches of that gesture from their view (so the window won’t deliver them). The window cancels the previously delivered touches with a ( `touchesCancelled(_:with:)`) message. If a gesture recognizer doesn’t recognize its gesture, the view receives all touches in the multi-touch sequence.

- `delaysTouchesBegan` — As long as a gesture recognizer, when analyzing touch events, hasn’t failed recognition of its gesture, the window withholds delivery of touch objects in the `UITouch.Phase.began` phase to the attached view. If the gesture recognizer subsequently recognizes its gesture, the view doesn’t receive these touch objects. If the gesture recognizer doesn’t recognize its gesture, the window delivers these objects in an invocation of the view’s `touchesBegan(_:with:)` method (and possibly a follow-up `touchesMoved(_:with:)` invocation to inform it of the touches current location).

- `delaysTouchesEnded` — As long as a gesture recognizer, when analyzing touch events, hasn’t failed recognition of its gesture, the window withholds delivery of touch objects in the `UITouch.Phase.ended` phase to the attached view. If the gesture recognizer subsequently recognizes its gesture, the touches are canceled (in a `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` message). If the gesture recognizer doesn’t recognize its gesture, the window delivers these objects in an invocation of the view’s `touchesEnded(_:with:)` method.

Note that “recognize” in the above descriptions doesn’t necessarily equate to a transition to the Recognized state.

### Subclassing notes

You may create a subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer` that recognizes a distinctive gesture — for example, a “check mark” gesture. If you’re going to create such a concrete gesture recognizer, be sure to import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift). This file declares all the methods and properties a subclass must either override, call, or reset.

Gesture recognizers operate within a predefined state machine, transitioning to subsequent states as they handle multi-touch events. The states and their possible transitions differ for continuous and discrete gestures. All gesture recognizers begin a multi-touch sequence in the Possible state ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.possible`). Discrete gestures transition from Possible to either Recognized ( `recognized`) or Failed ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.failed`), depending on whether they successfully interpret the gesture or not. If the gesture recognizer transitions to Recognized, it sends its action message to its target.

For continuous gestures, the state transitions a gesture recognizer might make are more numerous, as indicated in the following sequence:

The Changed state is optional and may occur multiple times before the Cancelled or Ended state is reached. The gesture recognizer sends action messages at each state transition. Thus for a continuous gesture such as a pinch, action messages are sent as the two fingers move toward or away from each other. The `enum` constants representing these states are of type `UIGestureRecognizer.State`. (Note that the constants for Recognized and Ended states are synonymous.)

Subclasses must set the `state` property to the appropriate value when they transition between states.

#### Methods to override

The methods that subclasses must override are described in Implementing subclasses. Subclasses must also periodically reset the `state` property (as described above) and may call the `ignore(_:for:)` method.

#### Special considerations

The `state` property is declared in `UIGestureRecognizer.h` as being read-only. This property declaration is intended for clients of gesture recognizers. Subclasses of `UIGestureRecognizer` must import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift). This file contains a redeclaration of `state` that makes it read-write.

# UIMenuSystem

An object representing a main or contextual menu system.

@MainActor
class UIMenuSystem

## Overview

A menu system groups root menus together. The `main` system has only one root menu while the `context` system can have multiple root menus, each built in different `UIResponder` objects like a view controller.

Use `UIMenuSystem` in your implementation of `buildMenu(with:)` to isolate changes to a specific system.

override func buildMenu(with builder: UIMenuBuilder) {
super.buildMenu(with: builder)

// Ensure that the builder is modifying the menu bar system.
guard builder.system == UIMenuSystem.main else { return }

// ...
}

You can also use a menu system to rebuild or revalidate menus as changes occur in your app. To rebuild a menu, call the `setNeedsRebuild()` method. Call `setNeedsRevalidate()` when you need the menu system to revalidate a menu.

For more information, see Adding menus and shortcuts to the menu bar and user interface.

Protocol

# UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate

The methods for providing the set of actions to perform on your content, and for customizing the preview of that content.

@MainActor
protocol UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

Use this protocol to provide UIKit with the contextual menu that you want to display. When a `UIContextMenuInteraction` object detects an appropriate interaction, it calls the `contextMenuInteraction(_:configurationForMenuAtLocation:)` method of your delegate. You use that method to specify the basic configuration details for your interface. In addition to your contextual menu, you can tell UIKit whether you want it to display a default preview interface or a custom view controller that you provide. You can also specify options for how you want UIKit to animate the presentation and dismissal of that interface.

For additional information about how to implement contextual menus, see Adding context menus in your app.

## Overview

Create a `UIAction` object when you want a menu element that performs its action in a closure. The following example adds an action-based menu to the File menu:

// Create a closure-based action to use as a menu element.
let refreshAction = UIAction(title: "Refresh") { (action) in
print("Refresh the data.")
}

// Use the .displayInline option to avoid displaying the menu as a submenu,
// and to separate it from the other menu elements using a line separator.
let refreshMenuItem = UIMenu(title: "", options: .displayInline, children: [refreshAction])

// Insert the menu into the File menu before the Close menu.
builder.insertSibling(refreshMenuItem, beforeMenu: .close)

Class

# UIKeyCommand

An object that specifies a key press perform on a hardware keyboard and the resulting action.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIKeyCommand

## Mentioned in

Choosing a user interface idiom for your Mac app

## Overview

Hardware keyboards allow a user to hold down the Control, Option, Command, or other modifier key and press another key in combination to initiate commands such as Cut, Copy, or Paste. You can use instances of this class to define custom command sequences that your app recognizes and then provide an appropriate response.

To use this class, you create instances and associate them with your app’s responder objects. Each responder has a `keyCommands` property that you can redefine and use to return the key command objects that responder supports. Key command sequences are generated only for devices with an attached hardware keyboard.

The system always has the first opportunity to handle key commands. Key commands that map to known system events (such as Cut, Copy, and Paste) are automatically routed to the appropriate responder methods. For other key commands, the system looks for an object in the responder chain with a key command object that matches the pressed keys. If it finds such an object, it then searches the responder chain, looking for the first object that implements the corresponding action method, and calls the first one it finds.

iPad apps that run in macOS can use `UIKeyCommand` to create menu elements that have keyboard shortcuts.

## Topics

Instance Property

# delegate

An object that provides text that a tooltip displays instead of the default text.

@MainActor
weak var delegate: (any UIToolTipInteractionDelegate)? { get set }

## Discussion

To provide tooltip text based on the current state or unique logic of your app, set the `delegate` property to an object that conforms to the `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` protocol and implements the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method. The method returns a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object containing the text to display in the tooltip. For example, the following code listing instructs the tooltip to show the name of the view’s background color instead of the `defaultToolTip` text. If the color name is unavailable, the method returns `nil`, which disables the display of the tooltip.

let configuration: UIToolTipConfiguration?
if let accessibilityName = backgroundColor?.accessibilityName {
configuration = UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "The color is \(accessibilityName).")
} else {
configuration = nil
}

return configuration
}

Instance Property

# toolTip

The default text to display in the control’s tooltip.

@MainActor
var toolTip: String? { get set }

## Discussion

Set this property to the text that should appear in the tooltip. If you want your app to determine the tooltip text at a later time — for instance, to determine the text based on the current state of your app — set the `delegate` property of `toolTipInteraction` after setting `toolTip` with the default text. For example, the following code listing sets the tooltip’s default text and delegate for a shopping cart button:

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart is empty."
button.toolTipInteraction?.delegate = self

If the delegate implements the method `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)`, the tooltip ignores the default text set in the `toolTip` property. For more information, see `toolTipInteraction`.

### Showing tooltips

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrol/tooltipinteraction

- UIControl
- toolTipInteraction

Instance Property

# toolTipInteraction

The tooltip interaction associated with the control.

@MainActor
var toolTipInteraction: UIToolTipInteraction? { get }

## Discussion

When you set the `toolTip` property, the control creates a `UIToolTipInteraction` object and assigns it to the `toolTipInteraction` property.

If you want to change the text of the tooltip based the current state of your app or application logic, assign a `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` object to `toolTipInteraction`‘s `delegate` property. For example, the following code listing sets the tooltip’s default text and delegate for a shopping cart button:

lazy var shoppingCartButtonWithTooltip: UIButton = {
var configuration = UIButton.Configuration.filled()
configuration.title = "Add to Cart"
configuration.image = UIImage(systemName: "cart", variant: .circle)
configuration.imagePlacement = NSDirectionalRectEdge.leading
configuration.imagePadding = 4

let action = UIAction { [unowned self] _ in self.cartItemCount += 1 }

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart is empty."
button.toolTipInteraction?.delegate = self

return button
}()

Then the delegate returns a tooltip configuration containing text that states the number of items in the shopping cart by implementing the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method:

let text: String
switch cartItemCount {
case 0:

Instance Property

# isEnabled

A Boolean value that indicates whether the tooltip interaction is in the enabled state.

@MainActor
var isEnabled: Bool { get set }

## Discussion

A view or control can only display a tooltip from an enabled interaction. Set the value of the `isEnabled` property to `true` to enable the interaction or `false` to disable it. The default value is `true`.
