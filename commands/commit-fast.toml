# Fast Commit Task

Generate 3 commit message suggestions based on the staged changes, then automatically use the first suggestion without user confirmation.

## Steps:
1. Run `git status` to see staged changes
2. Generate 3 commit message suggestions following conventional commit format
3. Automatically select the first suggestion
4. Execute `git commit -m` with the selected message

## Commit Types:
- feat: New features
- fix: Bug fixes
- docs: Documentation changes
- refactor: Code restructuring
- chore: Tooling and maintenance
- style: Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Adding or correcting tests
